            <p class="paragraph">
                To many, Scotland is a land of misbehaving drunkards, who live in clans, wear kilts, guzzle Scotch, and
                speak in thick accents. The country is cold, dark, and unforgiving. The football is similarly abject:
                the national team has been crap for ages, and Scottish sides regularly get boyed off in Europe. All in
                all, Scotland seems grim.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, if you dig deeper, you’ll see that Scotland’s not what its detractors—mainly the English—have
                made it out to be. It’s a belting place, with a rich legacy of culture and prestige. Also, Scotland’s
                clubs were once able to go toe-to-toe with Europe’s top sides. Unfortunately, recent
                predicaments—poverty, homelessness, mass emigration, and poor football—sully its image.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                What is Scotland’s legacy? Why has the country been in perpetual decline? How did Scottish football go
                from Jimmy Johnstone, Billy Bremner, and Denis Law, to Oliver McBurnie and Grant Hanley? And, despite
                this drastic decline, why do I still back the Scots to make a run in the 2024 European Championship?

            <p class="paragraph">
                In this article, I’ll shine some light on Scotland’s greatness. The Scots have done bits for the British
                Empire, various developing countries, and world football. They’re an understated, proud group of people.
                However, this isn’t charity: the Scots can fend for themselves, as history has proven. Rather, it’s an
                ode to them. God bless the Scots, Scotland, and Scottish football.

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-1">Early History (10,800 BC - 1025 AD)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To start, let’s look at Scotland’s makeup. As alluded to earlier, Scotland is a dark, cold place for
                most of the year. However, it wasn’t always like this. In fact, for the majority of history, it was
                worse. During the Last Ice Age, Scotland had temperatures of negative 60 degrees Celsius, and its land
                was covered by a sheet of ice that was around a mile-deep. Even after the ice had melted, Scotland
                remained a frigid tundra, and few were able to create permanent settlements.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                But, during the Classical Era, various groups established themselves all across Scotland. The Britons, a
                Welsh-Celtic group, settled on the Clyde. The Picts—a mysterious group of warriors, likely coming from
                northern Germany—lived far north, beyond the Forth and Clyde. Little is known about them, aside from the
                fact that they weren’t Gaelic. But, we do know that they were far more aggressive than the Britons, as
                they regularly launched raids into the south. Additionally, the Gaelic Scots settled in the west,
                creating the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada. Many came from Ireland, but the Scots were distinct from the
                Irish, as much of their culture was home-grown and specific to their needs as Scotsmen.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                These groups were formidable. After Rome conquered most of Britain in the early 1st century AD, they had
                a go at the north. The Britons struggled, eventually ceding portions of land. But, the Picts and the
                Scots endured the Roman advances and counter-raided on numerous occasions. Eventually, the message got
                through. Roman Emperor Hadrian built his famous wall in 122 AD to consolidate Rome’s southern
                possessions (e.g. England), as these northern groups were far too resillient.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/HadrianWall.webp" />
                <p class="caption">Where Hadrian's Wall was.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, these groups also fought amongst each other. They’d form alliances to fight off enemies, break
                these alliances to fight one another, and then recreate these alliances to fight new enemies. As a
                result, for centuries, power oscillated amongst the Picts, the Gaelic Scots, and the emerging
                Northumbrian English. It was chaos. Order only came in the mid-9th century, when Scottish leader Cináed
                mac Ailpín united the Picts and Scots to form the Kingdom of Alba, or Scotland. This formalised a
                singular Scottish identity across northern Britain, albeit centuries of inter-marriage and
                inter-settlement had laid the seeds.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">The unification came just in time. The Vikings began raiding, and a unified force stood
                the best chance at resisting. From about 800 to 1050 AD, the Vikings sailed off to various foreign
                lands—like Scotland, Russia, England, and Ireland—and relentlessly pillaged everything in sight,
                demolishing villages and enslaving many. These chaps were steely and ruthless.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Vikings.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">The Vikings came in on long-boats and did damage.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">However, so were the newly-unified Scots. Whilst Viking raids were frequent, Scottish
                groups resisted. Much like the Romans, the Vikings found it difficult to breach the Scots’ defences.
                They were able to plunder the Island of Iona and destroy a few monasteries, but true Viking settlement
                and damage was limited to the islands—e.g. the Isle of Man and Iona—and the far north. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The English, however, struggled, ultimately letting the Vikings conquer ¾ of its kingdoms after fifteen
                years of conquest. By the 11th century, the majority of England was ruled by Vikings, after successful
                expeditions by Sweyn Forkbeard and Cnut the Great. In Ireland, the Vikings destroyed most monasteries
                and enslaved many. These newly-enslaved men were then sent to Dublin, where they were sold to the
                Moors.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As the Kingdom of Alba entered the 2nd millennium, it was a uniquely Gaelic realm, populated by
                no-nonsense, gritty men. Although invaders—e.g. the Romans, Vikings and Northumbrian English—did damage,
                the damage paled in comparison to that done to the English and the Irish. Additionally, whilst the
                Anglos, Jutes, and the Saxons dominated England during the 9th century, they struggled to assert
                themselves in the Kingdom of Alba. These disparities put the Scots in a unique position, strengthening
                their culture and identity.
            </p>


            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-2">Middle History (1025 AD - 1700 AD)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As these lads entered the later stages of the Middle Ages, external influences crept in. The Normans,
                who were prominent in England, expanded their influence. After William the Conqueror became England’s
                first Norman king in 1066, Norman settlements spread across England and, to a lesser extent, Scotland.
                King David I of Scotland (1124-1153) promoted Norman settlement by offering land and financial
                incentives.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/NormanConquest.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">In the 11th century, the Normans invaded and occupied England. Some came to Scotland.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As a result, a sizable Anglo-Norman contingency grew, especially in Moray, Mearns, and Gowrie. As they
                did in England, they promoted feudal landholding systems, which were adopted all across the Lowlands. As
                a result, Scotland began to Anglicise, albeit notable distinctions remained, especially in the
                Highlands. The Highlanders resisted feudalism and stayed true to their Gaelic Scottish roots, even as
                James II and James V sought to impose their rule. Clans, kinship, and chieftains remained. Scottish
                kings, realising the futility of compulsion, were forced to negotiate with earls in the Highlands and
                the Islands to maintain their influence.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Furthermore, as the Kingdoms of England and Scotland strengthened, their relationship became more
                strained. From the 11th century onwards, the Scots and the English quarreled over spheres of influence.
                Certain Scottish kings had peaceful relations with England—such as Alexander III—but others—like Malcolm
                III—were more bloodthirsty, frequently raiding England’s northern posessions, like Northumberland and
                Carlisle.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The Kingdoms’ kings had oscillating relationships. Certain kings were more violent than
                others. In 1173, Henry II made William the Lion his vassal and forced him to give up castles in
                Edinburgh and Sterling. In 1296, John Balliol surrendered Scotland to the English, allowing them to tax
                and patrol the Scots. However, thanks to the efforts of William Wallace and Robert I, Scotland regained
                its independence in March 1328. Later, Robert I’s son married the daughter of Edward III, the English
                king, which reduced quarrels. Afterwards, the likes of Henry IV occasionally invaded Scotland, but the
                Scots endured these invasions, and Scotland remained independent. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">In the end, English meddling helped the Scots cement their unique identity. In the 1320
                Declaration of Arbroath, written to persuade the pope to denounce England’s subjugation of Scotland,
                Robert I portrayed the Scots as a proud people, who were able to resist the Danes, English, and Norse,
                and who had the right to govern themselves. It didn’t work, but it strengthened the Scottish resolve,
                and they promptly won independence in 1328.
            </p>
            <div class="picture-caption-container">

                <p class="caption">Robert the Bruce, a Scottish national hero. He liberated Scotland from English
                    subjugation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Eventually, with James VI’s ascension to the English crown in 1603, England and
                Scotland were, on paper, united, marking the Union of the Crowns. It didn’t end the tensions between the
                Scots and the English. It also did not stop internal discontent, as seen by the regular clashes between
                the Jacobite Highlanders and the Anglicised Lowlanders. But, the countries were mostly stable, and the
                17th century saw an increase in productive relations.
            </p>


            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-3">Golden Era (1700 AD - 1914 AD)</h1>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, as the 18th century approached, Scotland’s situation was dire. The Scots, having seen the
                success of the British East India Company, created their own imitation—the Darien Company—in hopes of
                replicating its glory by colonising Panama. The Darien Company raised around £400k, much of which came
                from the Scottish government. Unfortunately, the expeditions, which took place in the 1690s, failed.
                Famine, disease, and poor yields were rife, and the Scottish economy was bankrupted. Concurrently, there
                were poor harvests back in Scotland, causing many to starve. Scotland’s grave predicament, as well as
                well-timed bribes by the English, led to the Union of 1707. Thus, England absorbed Scotland, and Great
                Britain was born.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Trade</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">But, the Union was a blessing. Although most of Scotland’s autonomy was lost—for
                example, Scottish Parliament disappeared—Scotland’s ties to the affluent England created avenues of
                trade. According to Tom Devine, in 1758, “Scottish tobacco imports” from America were greater than those
                of “London, Bristol, Liverpool, and Whitehaven” combined. Ireland, however, had little to no stake in
                the prospering American markets. The English passed the Act of 1696, which banned most American imports.
                As a result, both England and Scotland had quasi-monopolies over American trade.</p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Tobacco.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Tobacco was a massive industry in America, and the Scots profited from it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Similarly, the Scots dominated the West Indian sugar trade. “Sugar princes” became
                millionaires, and organisations, such as Alexander Houstoun & Company, surged.b Scotland’s economy was
                on the rise, and Glasgow, Clyde, Edinburgh, and other cities benefitted. </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Innovation</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Beyond a booming economy, Scotland also became a hub of innovation. The Scots always emphasised the
                importance of reading and education, as they believed that people needed to read the Bible. The
                University of St. Andrews, for example, was founded early—in 1413—and was immensely cheaper than Oxford
                University and Cambridge University, meaning you didn’t need to be posh to be literate. University of
                Glasgow and Edinburgh University followed in 1451 and 1583 respectively. Further, the Calvinist belief
                in doing your best work—all the time, for the glory of God—ushered the Scots towards self-improvement,
                mainly via education.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">With educated upper and middle classes, along with its booming economy, Scotland grew.
                Edinburgh and Glasgow, in particular, prospered. Their populations surged—especially in the midst of the
                Industrial Revolution—which increased urban development, employment, and immigration. Eventually,
                immigration forced Edinburgh to expand, so the Edinburgh Town Council built the northern, Georgian New
                Town, which was connected to the Old Town via the North Bridge. The bridge still stands, adding to
                Edinburgh’s distinctive charm.
            </p>
            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/NorthBridge.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Edinburgh's lovely North Bridge.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">As a result of their growth, these cities became melting pots for ideas. Many Scottish
                Enlightenment thinkers—such as David Hume, William Robertson, and William Ferugsson—lived close to one
                another, often crossing paths. This drove the Enlightenment, as these chaps were able to draw
                inspiration from and bounce ideas off one another. Such interactions elevated the likes of Adam Smith,
                Francis Hutcheson, Henry Peter Brougham, and Henry Home to higher levels of understanding. As a result,
                Edinburgh and Glasgow gained lofty reputations, prompting Voltaire to remark that “it is to Scotland
                that we look for our idea of civilisation.”</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The rest of Scotland developed, too, with new roads and bridges connecting the isolated
                Highlands to the rest of Scottish society. The Caledonian Canal, for example, opened the Highlands to
                commercial traffic. Despite the Highland clearances, the Scots began taking more interest in their
                Highlander heritage. Even the likes of Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson—who, respectively, founded the
                modern fields of economics and sociology—saw the value of the Highlanders. In particular, Smith
                appreciated the health and courage benefits associated with Highlander-esque militias. Coupled with the
                influence of Walter Scott, whose work about the Highlands increased interest, Scotland’s tourism
                industry boomed.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Impact on America</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Scottish impact extended beyond Scotland. For centuries, Protestant countries—like Norway and
                Sweden—relied on Highlander military support. For example, in the 17th century, Gustavus Adolphus
                recruited the military services of the Highlander Clan Munro, whose power helped transform Sweden into a
                global superpower. Further, Scots were involved in the Rotterdam stock exchange, founded in 1598.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">But, during the Industrial Age, Scottish impact multiplied. As alluded to earlier, the
                Scots moulded America. From between 1717 to 1776, around 250,000 Ulstermen came to America, most of whom
                had Scottish backgrounds. Also, throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, around 3 million Scots emigrated
                to all sorts, mainly America. Similar to the Irish, the Scots descended upon the United States, bringing
                valuable skills and knowledge to the fledging country. The civil engineering expertise of the Clyde
                shipbuilders, for example, was crucial to the development of American engineering, and the doctors,
                politicians, etc. all modernised the country.</p>

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">One of Scotland’s most important influences, though, was education. Many American
                universities—like Princeton, William & Mary, Columbia, and Brown—were influenced by Scottish education.
                In particular, Princeton had a deep connection to the Scots, having been (partially) founded by
                Ulsterman Samuel Blair. Many of its early presidents were Scottish. One of them, John Witherspoon,
                modelled its curriculum off Edinburgh University. Later, James McCosh founded the graduate school and
                schools of science, and erected numerous buildings around campus.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Scottish investment was also omnipresent. The Scottish government invested millions
                into American railroads. In addition, Scottish entrepreneurs boosted the United States’s economy. Andrew
                Carnegie, for example, founded the Carnegie Steel Company and employed tens-of-thousands. When J.P.
                Morgan bought the company in the early 20th century, Carnegie became one of the richest men ever and
                proceeded to construct pools, auditoriums, libraries, etc., all over the country.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">All in all, the Scots were key to America’s development. Whilst many were proud of
                their Scottish heritage, they quickly assimilated and attached to the American identity, partially why
                many are unaware of Scotland’s impact on America. The Irish, on the other hand, maintained their links
                to Ireland, establishing large Irish communities (e.g. Philadelphia and Boston) and bringing over Irish
                politics, as seen by the Orange Riots of 1870 and 1871. Coupled with their poor living conditions—many
                lived in ghettoes—and lack of education, anti-Irish sentiment was, unfortunately, rife. The mistreatment
                of the Irish in the North was even used by Southerners to defend slavery, as they argued that slaves
                were treated better in the South.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Empire Builders</h1>

            <p class="paragraph">Beyond America, the Scots were crucial for the British Empire, helping consolidate its
                holdings. After the Revolutionary War, the British were weak. Despite incredible naval power, and the
                deployment of Highlanders, they’d lost their richest colony. Further, British loyalists were bombed-out
                of the United States, fleeing to Canada. All in all, they looked like jokes. However, 30 years after the
                Revolutionary War, Britain became Europe’s most powerful state. How did Britain undergo such a
                remarkable turnaround? You know the answer.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After losing America, the Brits consolidated their holdings in Canada. The Hudson's Bay
                Company (HBC) and the Northwest Company (NWC) heightened their dominance over the fur trade. The HBC—run
                by Sir George Simpson, a Highlander from Ross-shire—grew to trade across “3 million square miles of
                territory.” Incredible. The HBC and the NWC employed loads of Scots, often from the Orkney Islands, as
                these chaps were gritty enough to survive in Canada’s unforgiving cold. They also employed the services
                of the loyalist Highlanders, who, again, pissed off out of the United States. With their influence,
                these companies helped turn Montreal and Halifax into prosperous trading centres.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Also, Scottish muscle helped the British defeat the French in Trafalgar and Waterloo.
                By finishing the belligerent Napoleon, the Empire cemented itself as Europe’s strongest state. Further
                victories—such as in the 1840 Opium War, a war started by Scottish opium traders—were backed by Scottish
                muscle and ingenuity, with John Laird’s iron ships playing a key role in demolishing opposition.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After these battles, Scottish regiments, like the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment,
                received heroes’ welcomes. To commemorate their bravery, citizens created graffiti, songs, and symbols.
                However, this was nothing new. For example, in Ulster, a country comprised of ethnic Scots, people had
                been memoralising the Siege of Derry for years. In later years, the 36th (Ulster) Division’s efforts in
                Somme were treated similarly. All in all, the Scots are a proud people. It is imperative to stand up for
                what’s right, make sacrifices, and fight back against oppressors, as the Romans and Vikings can attest.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Further, the Scots helped urbanise Australia. Originally, Australia was a country
                dominated by uncouth, violent prisoners, but the Scots helped modernise it. One of Australia’s early
                politicians, the Hebridean Lachlan Macquarie, built schools, roads, and churches, which boosted
                education, development, and prosperity. Further, as the Empire accumulated more-and-more land, sheep
                farming became a massive industry, with Scottish entrepreneurs cashing in. Unfortunately, much of this
                land was at the expense of the Aboriginals, who were massacred by disease and hostilities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Scottish influence was largely positive, though, and Scots migrated with good
                intentions. By the early 1800s, they started exploring Africa. Expeditions were spurred on by ministers,
                like Thomas Chalmers, who urged people to spread Christianity for philanthropic purposes. Macgregor
                Laird and David Livingstone were receptive to this call-to-arms and went off on expeditions. Few had
                explored central and western Africa before, as many believed it to be a disease-ridden, violent place,
                but Livingstone proved them wrong. He spent decades in Africa, fighting tigers, malaria, and (initially)
                hostile populations.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">His persistence paid off, and he assimilated. He converted many to Christianity and
                worked to modernize towns. After spending time in African communities, he came to despise the slave
                trade. To protect against Arabic slave traders, he armed African chiefs and encouraged trade among the
                chiefdoms to reduce their reliance on the slave trade. However, in 1873, he succumbed to malaria.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">His legacy influenced the European “Scramble for Africa” in the 19th century. But, many
                Africans appreciated his efforts. Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda called him the “first freedom
                fighter,” and various African cities have kept the names he gave them—such as Malawi’s Livingstonia and
                Blantyre, and Zambia’s Livingstone.

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-4">Decline and Modern Period (1914 AD - Present)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">However, Scotland began declining after World War I, as centuries of emigration
                dwindled its pool of skilled workers, hurting domestic industries. Despite progress via the National
                Services Scotland (NHS), television, and improved housing, low wages drove emigration to places like
                Australia, England, Jamaica, and, surprisingly, Eastern Europe, where Scots have an interesting
                history—from 1691 to 1703, Aberdonian Alexander Chalmers served four terms as mayor of Warsaw. Between
                1951 and 1981, over 753,000 Scots emigrated, nearly half of them to England.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Further, Scotland’s domestic industries took a nosedive, and not just because of the
                dwindling workforce. Barring temporary rises during World War 1 & 2, the global demand for jute, coal,
                and ships declined, hurting places like Clyde and Dundee. The increase in tertiary work—the services
                sector—also propelled the decline, hurting the agricultural and industrial industries. This also hurt
                Yugoslavia, contributing to its violent break-up.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">After World War II, Scotland shifted away from traditional industries, leading to
                widespread factory closures and job losses. Labour governments stepped in to ease this transition,
                working with unions and providing grants to companies like Chrysler UK and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.
                Their goal was to safeguard the economic security of working-class families, aiming to reduce the impact
                of industrial decline on local communities and create new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">However, under the Conservative tutelage of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher,
                deindustrialisation accelerated. Edward Heath minimised state support for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, and
                Thatcher notoriously waged war against unions and encouraged privatisation. Following closures in Timex
                plants, Dundee lost 1,675 industrial jobs. Also, after the closure of a massive car plant in Linwood in
                1981, over 4,800 workers were made redundant. Within the span of a century, prospering cities had turned
                into bastions of unemployment and poverty.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">

                <p class="caption">Working men and women, protesting against rapid deindustrialisation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">The Linwood closure underscored a significant trend during Thatcher's neoliberal era:
                privatised companies shuttered and relocated, impacting thousands. By 1971, Glasgow's shipbuilding
                workforce had dwindled to around 11,000, just 10% of its Edwardian peak. Despite sit-ins and work-ins,
                like those at Clydeside in the '60s and '70s, deindustrialization persisted. Conservative support for
                deindustrialisation spurred the Scottish National Party's rise and the Conservative Party's decline,
                while Anglophobia grew, as London-based decision-makers (“faceless men”) became targets of resentment.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">These days, poverty and unemployment persist. From 2014 to 2017, approximately one
                million Scots, including around 230,000 children, were living in poverty. Many, particularly in the
                Scottish Labour Party, attributed this to UK government cuts and placed the blame on the Tories. After a
                brief decline, child poverty has been rising in recent years. Although relative poverty had been
                decreasing since 1995, it started increasing again, reaching 24% in 2023, mainly due to the impacts of
                COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As for what the near future holds: who knows. We’re living in strange, strange times,
                and change takes ages. But, the Scots have bounced back from worse, so I have faith in them. The Scots
                have far too much knowledge, steel, and spirit. If anyone can bring about such a drastic and positive
                change, it's the Scots. Eventually, they’ll be back.
            </p>

                English game, Scotland's period of European success (e.g. Dundee United, Aberdeen, Celtic, Rangers,
                Gilzean's Dundee), Scottish football's international standing, the Murray vs. McCann era of the Old
                Firm, and Scottish football's current state. It'll take some time. I'll break it up into

                There's a lot I can put here. Leeds, United, Liverpool, etc. were all built by Scotsmen post-WW2.
                Pre-WW2, there's a lot of others: Preston, Sunderland, Newcastle, etc. Again, I need to finalise this. I
                haven't written much.

            <h1 class="section-leader-title" id="section-d">2024 Euros</h1>
            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-7">Competition</h1>

            <p class="paragraph">
                This year, Scotland’s biggest competitors are England, Spain, Germany, and Portugal. Some would put
                Italy, Holland, and Belgium into that list, but I’m not going to. Whilst those sides have pockets of
                talent, I don’t rate their depth. For example, look at Belgium. They’ve got Kevin de Bruyne, a magician.
                But, simultaneously, they rely on Romelu Lukaku, a serial bottlejob, to lead their attack. He nullifies
                De Bruyne’s quality. Belgium have also lost incredible footballers—like Vertonghen, Alderweireld,
                Nainggolan, and Hazard—in recent years. As a result, I don’t rate their chances. They’re top-heavy.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/LukakuVandalised.webp" />
                <p class="caption">A vandalised Romelu Lukaku mural, after he pushed for a move to Juventus.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">But, top-heaviness is not always an issue. Sir Alex Ferguson once claimed that he could
                win the European Cup with Zinedine Zidane and 10 planks of wood. But De Bruyne is no Zidane. He doesn’t
                have Zizou’s grace. Obviously he’s a world-class footballer, but everything about him is mechanical: the
                dribbling, passing, etc. There is no rawness to his game. He’s like a robot: everything’s refined and
                manufactured; there are no rough edges, none of the imperfections that drew people to the likes of
                Thierry Henry, Günter Netzer, and George Best. You need some rawness to your game, a burst of
                spontaneity, or else you become predictable. Unfortunately, he has none.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">De Bruyne and City are a perfect match. A manufactured player for a manufactured
                football club. There’s no glory in either of their accomplishments, as there’s no risk of jeopardy. The
                same way there’s no risk of City having an off-season, there’s no risk of De Bruyne cocking up a cross.
                It all means nothing. So, if Belgium win the Euros off the back of De Bruyne’s quality, it’ll mean
                nothing, so I don’t consider them a legitimate threat to Scotland.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As for Italy, I think they have decent depth. But, they’ve weakened since their 2021
                triumph, with Jorginho, Chiesa, and Bonucci having declined; also, Chiellini has retired. These are big
                losses. With this much degradation, it’s hard to say Italy have a chance.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Finally, Holland have great players, such as Van Dijk, de Jong, and de Ligt. But, like
                Belgium, their attack is spearheaded by a dilettante: Memphis Depay. I know all about Memphis Depay. He
                exposed himself at Manchester United. Whilst at the club, instead of learning to beat a defender or
                pass, he sulked and clashed with the media. He showed no inclination towards improving or trying to make
                it work at United. Instead, he wanted to look flash. He quickly bought himself an all-black Mercedes
                G-Wagon, with “M7” emblazoned on its headrests. Nauseating.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">When Cristiano Ronaldo had originally signed for United, he immediately multiplied his
                previous efforts, understanding that he still had a long way to go. His attitude was spot-on. Like
                Mikhail Gorbachev once said, “If you don’t move forward, sooner or later you begin to move backward."
                Depay moved backward. He was happy to take his foot off the accelerator, shift his priorities, and
                indulge in customised headrests. Hence, he was quickly bombed-out of United. Since then, he has only
                succeeded at one club: Lyon (where, still, he won no trophies). He was poor at Barcelona, and he’s
                hardly impressed for Atletico. I wish him the best, but he’s not the one to lead Holland to success.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, onto the top sides. England are strong. I think Kane, Bellingham, Foden, and
                Alexander-Arnold are world-class, and that Saka, Rashford, Rice, and Stones are great. Off squad quality
                alone, they are easily the favourites. However, when it comes to the Auld Rivalry, squad quality goes
                out the window. Emotions dominate, and the Scottish footballers accordingly raise their game. As a
                result, Scotland fair well against the Auld Enemy. Very rarely do Scotland get battered by England,
                albeit that 9-3 still lives in the memories of older fans. If the two sides meet, I reckon it’ll be a
                slugfest, with McTominay scoring the winner.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As for the Iberian Peninsula, Spain have a great squad. Oyarzabal, Rodri, Grimaldo,
                Carvajal, and Merino are all class. Spain won the Nations League in 2023 and dominated their Euro
                Qualifiers, even beating Scotland in Spain. However, the Scottish won the reverse fixture in Glasgow,
                with an inspired McTominay scoring a double. Another side that are good, but not miles ahead of
                Scotland. If the Scottish players’ attitudes are spot-on, then they have a great chance to beat Spain.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Portugal are also great. They won all 10 of their Euro Qualifiers, smashing the likes
                of Bosnia and Luxembourg in the process. However, as Slovenia proved in March, these lads aren’t
                infallible. Portugal regularly field geriatrics and immobiles—Ronaldo, William Carvalho, Pepe, and
                Danilo Pereira being prime examples. It’s fine to field one or two—France had Giroud in 2018—but when
                you field five or six, it’s a big, big problem.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Part of Spain’s issue in 2014 was that they were too slow and stiff. Xavi, Iniesta,
                Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Busquets, David Villa were all incredible footballers, but in 2014, most of them
                were immobile. As a result, they got boyed off in the group stage. Against Holland, Robben had free rein
                to sprint around and take the piss. As a result, Holland won 5-1, and Spain was on an early flight home.

            <p class="paragraph">If Portugal surrounds veterans like Ronaldo and Pepe with younger, faster players like
                Rúben Dias, Bruno Fernandes, Rafael Leão, and Bernardo Silva, they have a good chance of succeeding.
                However, outside of their 1966 World Cup run and Euro 2016 victory, they've historically underperformed.
                France’s 2010 debacle pales in comparison to Portugal's 1986 World Cup disaster, and between 1970 and
                1998, Portugal only
                made the World Cup once. While their current team is strong, history often repeats itself. And, with
                Roberto Martínez at the helm, it probably will.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Football's Decline</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">All in all, I don’t rate many international sides. I think that football has declined
                massively the last decade-and-a-half. For example, look at Italy’s 2006 World Cup squad. It’s filled
                with footballing royalty: Luca Toni, Fabio Cannavaro, Gennaro Gattuso, Alessandro Del Piero, Mauro
                Camoranesi, Filippo Inzaghi, Andrea Pirlo, Francesco Totti, Gianluigi Buffon. I don’t think any of
                Italy’s players today gets into that squad.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Italy2006.webp" />
                <p class="caption">Italy's 2006 squad. What a side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Further, Spain’s 2010 squad: Iker Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Iniesta, Fernando
                Torres, Sergio Ramos, David Villa. David Silva and Juan Mata couldn’t even crack the bench for them.
                These days, those 2 would be Spain’s best players, albeit Rodri competes.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Why’s this? I think that the abolition of foreign player limits has damaged the game.
                Sorry—this isn’t entirely irrelevant, and it might come off as a diatribe—but I think the game’s
                declined. If asked to list the top international teams from pre-Bosman times (e.g. pre-1995), most would
                likely name the 1960 Soviet Union, 1954 Hungary, 1984 France, and 1970 Brazil teams, amongst others.
                What do these sides have in common? Most of their players, if not all, played in their domestic
                countries, and, most importantly, they thrived there.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Take the 1970 Brazilian squad for example. These days, Tostão, Jairzinho, Carlos
                Alberto, Gérson, and (especially) Pelé would not have spent the majority of their careers in Brazil.
                They would have all been snapped up by a Real Madrid or Barcelona when they were 17. For proof, look at
                Real’s recent history with Brazillians: Vinícius, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Reinier were all purchased as
                teenagers, for massive sums. If Endrick commanded €60m, a 16 year old Pelé would’ve commanded €200m.
            </p>

                <p class="caption">Pelé celebrating his goal in the 1970 World Cup final. A big game player.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Vinícius and Rodrygo have done bits, but they are the exception. I think the game
                suffers when young players from smaller leagues prematurely join top teams. Depay would’ve been better
                off had he stayed another couple seasons at PSV, ameliorating his game and character, before entering
                the strange, cutthroat environment at Manchester United. Instead, he sunk at United, halted his
                development, and, relative to early expectations, has underperformed—albeit he’s still had a decent
                career. Moving to a new country—where one needs to adapt to different customs and a new language—is not
                easy. But, if you are mature and have a good footballing education under your belt, you stand a fighting
                chance.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some, like Vinícius and Erling Haaland, have defied the odds, but they’re rare. For
                every Haaland, you get 20 Francisco Trincãos and 10 Renato Sancheses. But, I get why young players move.
                These days, modern football’s lopsided nature demolishes the possibility of a (relatively) obscure
                footballing country, like Scotland, Hungary, or Russia, dominating with a squad of domestic players.
                This is why young lads feel the need to uproot.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Back in the days, Hungarian sides regularly made runs into the UEFA Cup, European Cup,
                and Cup Winners’ Cup. The likes of Ferencváros, Videoton, and MTK Budapest were able to regularly put
                away the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, and Juventus; Dinamo Kiev, Torpedo Moscow, and Dinamo
                Tbilisi (not Russian, but Soviet) also did bits. Nowadays, Manchester United, even with how crap they
                are, would blow all of these sides away. United’s squad is too good for them, as their financial
                firepower is unmatched. Even as poor as Antony is, he’d walk into Ferencváros’s and Torpedo Moscow’s
                sides.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Leeds1968.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">The Leeds United squad celebrating after beating Ferencváros in a European final.
                    Hard to imagine either of these sides making a European final these days.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Beyond the wealth gap, top teams act like vultures, raiding lesser-known clubs in
                countries like Russia, Sweden, and Hungary. Alexander Isak spent 11 years at Swedish club AIK, receiving
                significant resources and education, only for Dortmund to sign him the second he turned 17. After just
                two years, they offloaded him to Real Sociedad. It's wasteful and rude.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">If a UEFA-enforced foreigner limit is reintroduced into leagues, you’d see less of this
                waste. The top clubs would be forced to develop domestic talent and dissuaded from raiding lesser clubs.
                For example: instead of of wasting £70m on Kalvin Phillips and Mateo Kovačić, City would’ve given Romeo
                Lavia a chance and maintained their ties to their local community. (And, with how those two have
                performed for Abu Dhabi’s Manchester City, and how Lavia was for Southampton, there’s a good chance City
                would’ve been better off.)
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As a result, football’s quality would go up, and the international game would be in a
                better place. Mikel Merino and Joselu, Newcastle United rejects, wouldn’t be Spain’s best players; we’d
                see more David Silvas and Xabi Alonsos. Furthermore, smaller clubs and leagues would be able to compete
                again. We probably wouldn’t see the likes of Panathinaikos or Malmö FF make the Champions League final,
                the way they did in the past, but there’d be more parity. It’d fix most of the game’s problems.
                Unfortunately, it wouldn’t flush the turds that are Newcastle, PSG, and Manchester City, but it’d still
                be a big step forward.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Scotland's Time to Shine</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Quick side-note: perhaps I’m overrating past footballers a bit. People do it all the
                time, venerating the likes of Paolo Rossi, George Best, and Zinedine Zidane, as if they’re footballing
                paragons. They cleverly brush aside the fact that Rossi was finished at the age of 29, Best at 26, and
                that Zidane was often criticised for his inconsistency. Also, both Juventus and Real Madrid declined
                after a couple of years of the Zidane Experience, and Rossi’s career almost ended in disgrace at the age
                of 23, when he was banned for alleged match-fixing. The likes of Cruyff, Bobby Moore, Paul McGrath, etc.
                also had their downsides, which nobody seems to mention. Maybe this revisionism has rubbed off on me.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Zidane1998.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Zidane being sent off in France's match against Saudi Arabia, 1998. Had France not
                    won the competition, maybe we'd view Zidane as a hot-headed bottler. But, Zidane was a serial
                    winner, so people overlooked his flaws.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">It hasn’t. I’m right. If you watch clips/matches of the greats, you’ll instantly notice
                their sublime technical ability, vision, and bottle. These days, very few footballers shape up. You
                rarely see footballers taken on 5 players in a European Cup final, the way Best did in 1968 (at the age
                of 22!). I can only think of Mbappe, Haaland, Modric, and Kroos. Every other footballer is the same:
                incredible stamina, strength, and speed, but poor technical ability. They’re especially rife in the
                Premier League.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">This is probably a weird observation to many. Some believed that British footballers
                pre-1992 were talentless, brainless workhorses, who were only capable of smashing into challenges. But,
                the likes of Norman Whiteside, Bryan Robson, Graeme Souness, David Rocastle, and John Robertson would
                put many modern players to shame. A 27-year old John Robertson would make Adama Traoré like silly. His
                crossing and dribbling, as well as the general application of his talents, were levels above.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Regardless, one player spent his entire career at Nottingham Forest and Derby County,
                earning a pittance. Meanwhile, the other used his massive biceps to blag his way into a €100k/week deal
                at Barcelona. Another non-entity, Mykhailo Mudryk, swindled Chelsea with his neck tattoos and good
                looks. It’s a really, really weird climate. With the way the game’s gone, I reckon Christian McCaffrey
                could
                bag a move to Barcelona. Franz Mesmer could also snag a spot on a top club’s medical team. Probably
                City’s, given Guardiola’s history of dubious medical practices.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/McCaffrey.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">If Adama can bag a move to Barcelona, surely Christian McCaffrey could do the same?
                    They're both built the same, and McCaffrey could probably cross the ball better.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Anyway, as I said earlier, a lot of sides are poor, even the (supposed) top ones. Very
                little separates Scotland from them. This is just based on player quality, too. I also think managerial
                quality has gone down in recent years. I remember someone saying—I think it was Arsene Wenger—that a
                great manager can make a squad perform 10% better than the sum of its parts, whereas a crap one can make
                it perform 30% worse.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I think most managers lean towards the latter. Don’t believe me? England’s and
                Portugal’s fanbases want their respective managers out. Klopp has retired, and Guardiola’s (hopefully)
                on his way out at City. Like A$AP Rocky said on Potato Salad, “I find it hard to find actual talent.”
                There’s little managerial quality left; you don’t see any Ron Revies, Walter Smiths, Alex Fergusons, or
                Ron Saunderses in the game, and, as a result, the top clubs are suffering. Yesterday, I saw that Bayern
                Munich were courting Ten Hag, Julen Lopetegui, and Ralf Rangnick for their managerial role. Christ. I
                reckon David Moyes would do a better job than all three.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-8">Scotland's Key Players</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In this section, I’ll be focusing on 3 footballers: McTominay, Robertson, and McGinn. These are
                Scotland’s best players, and I think they’ll do damage this summer.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">This won’t be a tactical analysis; moreso, a description of the players’ qualities.
                I’ll leave the
                formation, positioning, and tactical roles to Steve Clarke. Besides, I think you’d get more from an
                overview of the players. I think football is similar to a greedy algorithm; if your players consistently
                make the best (or second best) decision 98% of the time, your team will likely win. I think it is that
                simple.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">As Bill Shankly once said, just keep the ball on the ground, and pass it to an open
                teammate. Sometimes
                simple is better. Anyway:</p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Scott McTominay</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Scott McTominay plays for Manchester United. He is lanky, but determined. He’s a
                midfielder by trade, but, when United are chasing a goal, he plays up front. As a player, he has many
                redeeming qualities: he’s got bottle, pace, strength, and solid defensive instinct. Surprisingly, he’s
                also got great offensive instinct. He times his runs well, akin to a young Dele Alli, and is a good
                finisher. All-in-all, he’s kinda like a jack-of-all-trades, but a master-of-none. </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/McTominayTackle.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">McTominay putting in a challenge that'd make Ollie Chessum proud.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Sometimes, his concentration lacks. When United lost 2-1 to Forest, he was majorly at
                fault for both goals, not paying attention to the lad behind him. Many also accuse him of hiding from
                the ball, i.e. not making himself open for passes. These are all fair criticisms, but I think they’re
                unfair. McTominay’s not the perfect footballer, but he gives it a go and has enough technical ability to
                create a role for himself at England’s biggest club. That’s not easy to do. Past “superstars”, like Di
                María, Pogba, and Verón, have failed.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">The reason McTominay has succeeded at United, whilst others have failed, is because he
                has bottle and an incredible attitude. He can’t coast on talent alone, like Pogba did for 6 years, so
                his effort has to be spot-on 100% of the time. His effort is why every United manager has loved him: Ten
                Hag, Solskjaer, and even José Mourinho. Mourinho, reputed to be a chequebook manager with a
                disinclination towards youth, gave McTominay a consistent role in the squad. He hasn’t done that with
                many other young lads. In 2018, at the club’s end-of-season party, Mourinho even created an award,
                Manager's Player of the Year, to recognise McTominay’s efforts. So, he’s clearly a good footballer.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Further, he shows up in big games, having put in great performances in matches against
                Arsenal, Liverpool, and Manchester City. Even for Scotland, he scored a last-minute winner against
                Israel in World Cup qualifiers and put Spain away with a brace. Moreover, in United’s infamous 2021
                Europa League final against Villarreal, he was the best player on the pitch. He didn’t hide; he pinged
                the ball cross-field, snuffed out Villarreal’s chances, and made himself available to his teammates.
                Unfortunately, United lost, but he was incredible.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Meanwhile, Paul Pogba, his flash midfield partner, was an absolute disgrace. He made
                poor decisions and had little-to-no impact on the game. He was at fault for Villarreal’s goal, as their
                free-kick came off the back of one of his many poor decisions. He had ages on the ball and plenty
                teammates open, but he picked the worst possible passing avenue and forced his teammate to make the
                foul. Poor.

            <p class="paragraph">Anyway, McTominay’s class.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Andy Robertson</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Andy Robertson is Liverpool’s left-back, and he’s world-class. He has humble origins.
                As a young lad, after being released from Celtic, he worked the tills at Marks & Spencer. After, Third
                Division Queen’s Park took a chance on him, and he impressed. After one season, Dundee United picked him
                up, where he also impressed. Again, after one season, Hull City signed him for a meagre £2.85 million.
                He wasn’t a consistent starter, and Hull got relegated in 2015. However, Robertson established himself
                as a star in the Championship and helped get Hull promoted. Unfortunately, the season after, Hull got
                relegated again, despite having him, Harry Maguire, Kamil Grosicki, and other quality footballers.</p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/RobertsonAndMaguire.webp" />
                <p class="caption">Two great footballers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">After Hull’s second relegation, both Robertson and Maguire were picked up by Liverpool
                and Leicester, respectively. Much like at Hull, Robertson had a slow start at Liverpool, only making 30
                appearances in his first season. However, the year Liverpool won the Champions League, Robertson had a
                blinder. He made 48 appearances and established himself as a mainstay in Klopp’s team, endearing himself
                to the fans with his incredible work ethic and attitude. However, beyond the intangibles, he’s a
                talented footballer, with incredible crossing ability and decision-making, albeit not on the level of
                his Trent Alexander-Arnold, his right-sided counterpart.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Scotland often play a back 3, Robertson plays as a left wing-back. He doesn’t have
                as much impact for Scotland as he does for Liverpool. Obviously a world-class talent, but he has
                struggled to elevate his teammates to his level. It’s easy playing one-twos with Wijnaldum and Mane, or
                putting in crosses for Van Dijk and Firmino, but replicating that impact with the likes of Oliver
                McBurnie and Ryan Christie is a different story. However, I back him to make a difference this
                tournament. Scotland have their strongest squad in decades, with Lyndon Dykes, Che Adams, and Jacob
                Brown offering more reliable outlets. This summer, he’ll do great.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">John McGinn</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, John McGinn is class. He has played for Aston Villa the last 6 years, and he’s
                been excellent. In his first season at Villa, 2018-19, he helped them get promoted and was named the
                club’s Player of the Season. Since then, Villa have survived in the Premier League and, barring the
                Gerrard blip, have gotten better each season. This season, they’ll likely finish 4th place and play
                Champions League football for the first time in ages. I think the last time they’d played in the
                European Cup was in 1983, the season after they’d won it. He has played a huge role in bringing Villa
                back to those heights.

                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Unlike McTominay, McGinn is naturally gifted, with great vision, passing, and
                dribbling. A bit of a silly comparison, but he’s akin to Mateo Kovačić, with better passing ability. His
                engine is incredible, too. All of these qualities have made him the first name on both Scotland’s and
                Villa’s team sheets. This chap is really, really good, and I genuinely mean that.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-9">Group</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Scotland’s group consists of Hungary, Germany, and Switzerland. If this were 1954, then Scotland would
                be in huge trouble. Puskás, Hidegkuti, and Kocsis would demolish the Scots, and Fritz Walter would score
                a hat-trick of outside-the-foot curlers. The Scots would exit the tournament in disarray.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Hungary1954.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Hungary's 1954 side. Arguably the best international side of all time.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">However, this is 2024. The Hungarian National Team has fallen off since the Hungarian
                Revolution of 1956. I reckon Scotland will batter them. They have one good footballer, Dominik
                Szoboszlai, a couple of decent ones (e.g. Willi Orban and Peter Gulacsi), and the rest are journeymen.
                Although they did the double over England in 2022, they’ve struggled against the likes of Luxembourg,
                Lithuania, and Bulgaria in recent times. They’re no pushovers, but they’re not world-beaters, either,
                and they haven’t been for a while.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Germany, on the other hand, are footballing royalty. They have won the World Cup four
                times and the European Championship three times. The likes of Gerd Müller, Franz Beckenbauer, Lothar
                Matthäus, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, Günter Netzer, and Bernd Schuster are amongst the greats, and
                Bundesliga sides have regularly dominated European competition.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">In 2024, Germany are still class. Xabi Alonso’s Bayer Leverkusen have established
                themselves as a top side, erasing their Neverkusen monicker. Bayern have lost Lewandowski and are
                struggling in the Bundesliga, but still have a chance of winning the Champions League. The national team
                has Kroos, Müller, Gündogan, and Neuer—all world-class footballers—but it seems their time is up. They
                fell at the first hurdle in both 2014 and 2018 and were unable to get past England in 2021. Having
                serial winners in the squad always boosts your chances, but their lacklustre performances in three of
                the last four major tournaments don't inspire confidence.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Germany2018.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Germany are a fantastic international side, arguably the best ever, but they've been
                    poor as of late.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Switzerland and Scotland are similar, though Scotland are bigger bottlers. Both sides
                haven’t gone deep into tournaments before, but Switzerland have had less quality. In recent times,
                they’ve churned out Granit Xhaka, Xherdan Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Manuel Akanji, and Stephan
                Lichsteiner—all of whom are class. Compared to Scotland’s recent output—Scott McTominay, Andy Robertson,
                and John McGinn—and it’s clear that the two countries are on similar pegging.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">However, in terms of historic quality, it’s a wash. Stéphane Chapuisat is Switzerland’s
                best ever player, and, to be fair, he was class. But, he’s one of the few world-class players that
                Switzerland have produced. As for Scotland, it’s a long list: Bremner, Law, Souness, Dalglish, Hansen,
                Robertson, Mackay, etc. Obviously, current quality is all that matters, but the Scots have a CV, whereas
                the Swiss don’t.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">All in all, I think Scotland draw 1-1 with Germany, and Scotland beat Switzerland 2-1
                and Hungary 3-0.
                I back the Scots to top the group; I think Germany will draw against Switzerland.
            </p>

                I need to finish up the rest before I can write a decent conclusion.
