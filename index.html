                To many, Scotland is a land of misbehaving drunkards, who live in clans, wear kilts, guzzle Scotch, and
                speak in thick accents. The country is cold, dark, and unforgiving. The football is similarly abject.
                The national team has been crap for ages, and Scottish sides regularly get boyed off in Europe. All in
                all, Scotland seems grim.

                Stones began his career with Barnsley, making his first-team debut in the Championship in March 2012 as
                a
                17-year-old. He joined Premier League club Everton for around £3 million in January 2013 and amassed 95
                appearances over four seasons. In August 2016, he signed for Manchester City for an initial £47.5
                million
                with add-ons. With the club, he has won five Premier League titles, two EFL Cups, two FA Cups, and the
                UEFA
                Champions League as part of a historic continental treble in the 2022–23 season.

                On 9 August 2016, Manchester City completed the signing of Stones for £47.5 million on a six-year
                contract
                with a potential extra £2.5 million in add-ons, making him the world's second most expensive defender in
                history, behind David Luiz. The announcement followed shortly after the leaking of his
                arrival, having been included in City's Champions League play-off round squad registration list which
                UEFA
                had published on their website prior to confirmation of the move. Through a 15% sell-on clause, Barnsley
                received £6.78 million from Stones' transfer to Manchester City, an amount larger than any transfer fee
                they
                had received in their history.

                Feijenoord claimed their first professional Eredivisie Championship and their sixth Dutch Championship
                in 1961. On the road to the title Ajax was beaten 9–5 in De Kuip, four of Feijenoord's goals were
                scored by Henk Schouten. The following season, they played their first European Cup match facing IFK
                Göteborg. The Swedes were beaten 0–3 in Gothenburg and 8–2 in Rotterdam. Feijenoord were
                eliminated by Tottenham Hotspur in the following round. In 1962, Feijenoord successfully defended
                their Dutch Championship title and reached the final of the Intertoto Cup 1961–62, where Feijenoord
                faced arch-rival Ajax in the final and subsequently lost 4–2.

                After the Romans left, there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars
                who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of Lindisfarne seven years earlier,
                stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them.
                While they were there, the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the north-east because it was
                the seat of the Bishop of Lindisfarne, making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into
                English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in
                995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham. The title has been revived as the Roman
                Catholic titular see of Cuncacestre.

                Celtic have a long-standing fierce rivalry with Rangers and, together, the clubs are known as the Old
                Firm. Their matches against each other are regarded as among the world's biggest football derbies. The
                club's fanbase was estimated in 2003 as being around 9 million worldwide and there are more than 160
                Celtic supporters clubs in over 20 countries. An estimated 80,000 fans travelled to Seville for the 2003
                UEFA Cup Final, and their "extraordinarily loyal and sporting behaviour" in spite of defeat earned the
                club Fair Play awards from FIFA and UEFA, respectively.

                Manager Sammy McIlroy led Macclesfield Town to the top of the Conference in 1993–94, but they were not
                promoted as Moss Rose did not meet Football League requirements. They won the FA Trophy for a second
                time in 1996. They again won the Conference title in 1996–97 and this time were promoted, winning
                promotion in their inaugural Football League campaign with a second-place finish in the Third Division
                in 1997–98. However they were immediately relegated from the Second Division. The club stayed in the
                fourth tier of the Football League from 1999 to 2012, losing a play-off semi-final in 2005, before being
                relegated back into the Conference. Despite financial constraints, manager John Askey led the club back
                into the Football League as champions of the National League in 2017–18. In 2018–19, the club avoided
                relegation back to the National League, but financial issues continued to affect it. After a points
                deduction activated on 11 August 2020, the club was relegated to the National League, the 5th tier of
