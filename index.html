            <p class="paragraph">
                To many, Scotland is a land of misbehaving drunkards, who live in clans, wear kilts, guzzle Scotch, and
                speak in thick accents. The country is cold, dark, and unforgiving. The football is similarly abject:
                the national team has been crap for ages, and Scottish sides regularly get boyed off in Europe. All in
                all, Scotland seems grim.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, if you dig deeper, you’ll see that Scotland’s not what its detractors—mainly the English—have
                made it out to be. It’s a belting place, with a rich legacy of culture and prestige. Also, Scotland’s
                clubs were once able to go toe-to-toe with Europe’s top sides. Unfortunately, recent
                predicaments—poverty, homelessness, mass emigration, and poor football—sully its image.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                What is Scotland’s legacy? Why has the country been in perpetual decline? How did Scottish football go
                from Jimmy Johnstone, Billy Bremner, and Denis Law, to Oliver McBurnie and Grant Hanley? And, despite
                this drastic decline, why do I still back the Scots to make a run in the 2024 European Championship?

                Stones began his career with Barnsley, making his first-team debut in the Championship in March 2012 as
                a
                17-year-old. He joined Premier League club Everton for around £3 million in January 2013 and amassed 95
                appearances over four seasons. In August 2016, he signed for Manchester City for an initial £47.5
                million
                with add-ons. With the club, he has won five Premier League titles, two EFL Cups, two FA Cups, and the
                UEFA
                Champions League as part of a historic continental treble in the 2022–23 season.

                On 9 August 2016, Manchester City completed the signing of Stones for £47.5 million on a six-year
                contract
                with a potential extra £2.5 million in add-ons, making him the world's second most expensive defender in
                history, behind David Luiz. The announcement followed shortly after the leaking of his
                arrival, having been included in City's Champions League play-off round squad registration list which
                UEFA
                had published on their website prior to confirmation of the move. Through a 15% sell-on clause, Barnsley
                received £6.78 million from Stones' transfer to Manchester City, an amount larger than any transfer fee
                they
                had received in their history.

                Uzbekistan is a secular state, with a presidential constitutional government in place. Uzbekistan
                comprises 12 regions (vilayats), Tashkent City, and one autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. While
                non-governmental organisations have defined Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with limited civil
                rights", significant reforms under Uzbekistan's second president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, have been
                made following the death of the first president, Islam Karimov. Owing to these reforms, relations with
                the neighbouring countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan have drastically
                improved. A United Nations report of 2020 found much progress toward achieving the UN's
                Sustainable Development Goals.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The Uzbek economy is in a gradual transition to the market economy, with foreign trade policy being
                based on import substitution. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at
                market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. With the gigantic power-generation
                facilities from the Soviet era and an ample supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has become the largest
                electricity producer in Central Asia. From 2018 to 2021, the republic received a BB−sovereign
                credit rating by both Standard and Poor (S&P) and Fitch Ratings. The Brookings Institution described
                Uzbekistan as having large liquid assets, high economic growth, low public debt, and a low GDP per
                capita. Uzbekistan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), United Nations (UN)
                and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

                The region currently known as the country of Uzbekistan has been referred to by many names over the
                millennia. The name, Uzbekistan first appears in 16th century literature. Other names for the region
                include: Transoxonia, Sogdia, and the Khanate of Bukhara. In the 14th century the region served as the
                birthplace, home, and capital of Tamerlane. Under Tamerlane, the region was a part of the Timurid Empire
                which extended from the Black Sea to the Arabian Sea, and to just outside of Delhi, India.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were Scythians who came from the northern
                grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan, sometime in the first millennium BC; when these nomads settled in
                the region they built an extensive irrigation system along the rivers. At this time, cities such as
                Bukhoro (Bukhara) and Samarqand (Samarkand) emerged as centres of government and high culture. By
                the fifth century BC, the Bactrian, Sogdian, and Tokharian states dominated the region.

                The label had been active since 2011 but had only released mixtapes and was not a fully functioning
                record company. After releasing Chief Keef's Finally Rich in December 2012, the label was set to release
                an album by Lil Reese in the following months, along with various mixtapes. However, on January 3, 2014,
                Chief Keef said that Glory Boyz Entertainment was "no more", and he was starting a new record label
                named Glo Gang. Prior to his death, Blood Money revealed in an interview the members of Glo Gang
                were Chief Keef, Tray Savage, Ballout, Capo, Tadoe, JusGlo, and himself.

                In 327 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire provinces of Sogdiana and
                Bactria, which contained the territories of modern Uzbekistan. Popular resistance to the conquest was
                fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the
                Macedonian Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The kingdom was replaced with the Yuezhi-dominated Kushan Empire in
                the first century BC. For many centuries thereafter the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by the Parthian
                and Sassanid Empires, as well as by other empires, for example, those formed by the Turkic Gokturk
                peoples.

                Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family
                members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, there was an orderly succession for several
                generations, and control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of
                Chagatai Khan, the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace
                prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom,
                the Golden Horde.

                Tamerlane also established an exchange of medical discoveries and patronised physicians, scientists and
                artists from the neighbouring regions such as India. His grandson Ulugh Beg was one of the world's
                first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the Chaghatai
                dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Transoxiana, although the Timurids were
                Persianate in culture. The greatest Chaghataid writer, Ali-Shir Nava'i, was active in the city of Herat
                (now in northwestern Afghanistan) in the second half of the 15th century.

                In October 2014, Chief Keef was dropped by Interscope Records. He confirmed via Twitter that every
                project he had planned, including the release of the long-awaited Bang 3, would still be released.
                Young Chop criticized Interscope's decision to drop Chief Keef. Despite being set for a December
                2014 release, Bang 3 did not materialize. Chief Keef's mixtapes, Mansion Musick set for a November
                28 release, and Thot Breakers set to release on February 14, 2015, were not released as announced.
                However, he was successful in releasing Big Gucci Sosa, a 12-track collaborative mixtape, with Gucci
                Mane, as well as Back from the Dead 2, which was made available for digital download from
                iTunes.

                Chief Keef self-produced 16 of the 20 songs on the mixtape. David Drake of Pitchfork Media said,
                "For his first steps into the rapper-producer territory, he shows promise—though it's tough to imagine
                most of these beats working outside the context of a Chief Keef album, as they are primed to frame his
                vocals." Rolling Stone ranked the mixtape 25th on its list of the 40 best rap albums of 2014
                commenting, "The bleak world from which he came still shapes his sound; it's a bleak and lonely record,
                with few guests and a darkly psychedelic shape formed by drugs and likely PTSD. Yet he finds a gleeful
                humanity inside the world's rotten core, with bluntly potent, economical rapping that gets strong
                mileage per word."

                On February 18, 2015, Chief Keef released Sorry 4 the Weight, a 20-track mixtape. Elliott Pearson of
                The Alibi commented: "Sorry 4 the Weight is another consistent chapter in the rapper's singular
                Midwestern gothic repertoire, and if 'What Up' is any indication, he's made serious progress as a
                beat-maker too." The mixtape was largely a solo effort, featuring only Andy Milonakis and Glo Gang
                labelmate, Benji Glo. In 2015, his track "Faneto" was slowly building momentum since its October
                2014 release. On April 24, 2015, Chief Keef announced his next album, titled The Cozart, saying
                it would be released soon. In 2015, he signed with FilmOn Music, a record label owned by Greek
                billionaire Alki David in 2015. Keef later named his son Sno FilmOn Dot Com Cozart to promoteBang 3,
                but the label retracted their naming rights to his son.

                Man". He also released a 17-track mixtape Two Zero One Seven in January 2017. Chief Keef joined

                character: Memphis Depay. Depay struggled at Manchester United, often clashing with the media over his
                poor performances, yet he was quick to purchase a customised Rolls Royce, emblazoned with “M7” on its
                headrests.

                Top footballers don’t do this. When Ronaldo had originally signed for United, he immediately multiplied
                his previous efforts, understanding that he still had a long way to go. Depay, on the other hand, was
                happy to take his foot off the accelerator and indulge in customised headrests. Hence, he’s only
                succeeded at one club: Lyon. After leaving them, he was poor at Barcelona, and he’s hardly pulled up any
                trees for Atletico. He is a microcosm of Manchester United’s decline.

                Anyway, England have their strongest side in ages. I think Kane, Bellingham, Foden, and Alexander-Arnold
                are world-class, and that Saka, Rashford, Rice, and Stones are great. They are easily the favourites.
                However, when it comes to the Auld Rivalry, squad quality goes out the window. The Scots understand the
                importance of the match to the fans, so they always raise their game. England have only beaten Scotland
                once in the last 7 years, albeit they’ve only played 3 times then. Regardless, Scotland have got a
                chance against the Auld Enemy. You never know when McTominay could strike.

            <p class="paragraph">
                As for the Iberian Peninsula, Spain have a great squad. Oyarzabal, Rodri, Grimaldo, Carvajal, and Merino
                are all class. Spain won the Nations League in 2023 and dominated their Euro Qualifiers, even beating
                Scotland in Spain. However, the Scottish won the reverse fixture in Glasgow, with an inspired McTominay
                scoring a double. Another side that are good, but not miles ahead of Scotland. If the Scottish players’
                attitudes are spot-on, then they have a great chance to win.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Portugal are also great. They won all 10 of their Euro Qualifiers, smashing the likes of Bosnia and
                Luxembourg in the process. However, as Slovenia proved in March, these lads aren’t infallible. Portugal
                regularly field geriatrics and immobiles—with Ronaldo, Pepe, and Danilo Pereira being prime examples.
                However, they’ve still got world-class talent in Dias, Fernandes, and Bernardo Silva, as well as great
                footballers in Leao, Felix, and Palhinha. These are no joke.

                Cozart has faced extensive, ongoing legal troubles throughout his career, including weapons possession
                charges, house arrest sentences, and a performance ban imposed by Chicago authorities. Despite
                parting ways with Interscope in late 2014, he continued self-releasing projects through his own Glo Gang
                label, including Nobody (2014), Back from the Dead 2 (2014), and Bang 3 (2015). In 2020 and 2023
                respectively, Cozart would reach his furthest chart success with his guest appearances on "Bean (Kobe)"
                by Lil Uzi Vert and "All the Parties" by Drake.

                Scotland’s group consists of Hungary, Germany, and Switzerland. If this were 1954, then Scotland would
                be in huge trouble. Puskás, Hidegkuti, and Kocsis would demolish the Scots, just as they did England,
                with their 6-3 and 7-1 victories at Wembley and in Budapest, respectively. Fritz Walter would score a
                hat-trick of outside-the-foot curlers to dispatch the Scots.

                However, this is 2024. The Hungarian National Team has fallen off since the Hungarian Revolution of
                1956; thus, Scotland will batter them. They have one good footballer, Dominik Szoboszlai, a couple of
                decent ones (e.g. Willi Orban and Peter Gulacsi), and the rest are journeymen. Although they did the
                double over England in 2022, they’ve struggled against the likes of Luxembourg, Lithuania, and Bulgaria
                in recent times. They’re no pushovers, but they’re not world-beaters, either, and they haven’t been for
                a while.

                Chief Keef began experimenting with producing his music in 2014. Meaghan Garvey of The Fader noted this
                was fitting as the rapper has "always been more concerned with vibe than meaning, and production is his
                most efficient tool to create a mood without getting bogged down by pesky syntax." In January, Chief
                Keef announced he was working on a new mixtape entitled Bang 3. In February, he unveiled the cover
                art to his upcoming mixtape Back From The Dead 2 the sequel to his critically acclaimed mixtape, Back
                From The Dead. During February, Chief Keef said his former lean addiction and bad mixing contributed
                to the lack of quality music on his two mixtape projects Bang Pt. 2 and Almighty So and that he was
                disappointed in both projects.
