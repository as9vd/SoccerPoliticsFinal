            <p class="paragraph">
                To many, Scotland is a land of misbehaving drunkards, who live in clans, wear kilts, guzzle Scotch, and
                speak in thick accents. The country is cold, dark, and unforgiving. The football is similarly abject:
                the national team has been crap for ages, and Scottish sides regularly get boyed off in Europe. All in
                all, Scotland seems grim.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, if you dig deeper, you‚Äôll see that Scotland‚Äôs not what its detractors‚Äîmainly the English‚Äîhave
                made it out to be. It‚Äôs a belting place, with a rich legacy of culture and prestige. Also, Scotland‚Äôs
                clubs were once able to go toe-to-toe with Europe‚Äôs top sides. Unfortunately, recent
                predicaments‚Äîpoverty, homelessness, mass emigration, and poor football‚Äîsully its image.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                What is Scotland‚Äôs legacy? Why has the country been in perpetual decline? How did Scottish football go
                from Jimmy Johnstone, Billy Bremner, and Denis Law, to Oliver McBurnie and Grant Hanley? And, despite
                this drastic decline, why do I still back the Scots to make a run in the 2024 European Championship?
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                In this article, I‚Äôll shine some light on Scotland‚Äôs greatness. The Scots have done bits for the British
                Empire, various developing countries, and world football. They‚Äôre an understated, proud group of people.
                However, this isn‚Äôt charity: the Scots can fend for themselves, as history has proven. Rather, it‚Äôs an
                ode to them. God bless the Scots, Scotland, and Scottish football.

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-1">Early History (10,800 BC - 1025 AD)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                To start, let‚Äôs look at Scotland‚Äôs makeup. As alluded to earlier, Scotland is a dark, cold place for
                most of the year. However, it wasn‚Äôt always like this. In fact, for the majority of history, it was
                worse. During the Last Ice Age, Scotland had temperatures of negative 60 degrees Celsius, and its land
                was covered by a sheet of ice that was around a mile-deep. Even after the ice had melted, Scotland
                remained a frigid tundra, and few were able to create permanent settlements.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                But, during the Classical Era, various groups established themselves all across Scotland. The Britons, a
                Welsh-Celtic group, settled on the Clyde. The Picts‚Äîa mysterious group of warriors, likely coming from
                northern Germany‚Äîlived far north, beyond the Forth and Clyde. Little is known about them, aside from the
                fact that they weren‚Äôt Gaelic. But, we do know that they were far more aggressive than the Britons, as
                they regularly launched raids into the south. Additionally, the Gaelic Scots settled in the west,
                creating the Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada. Many came from Ireland, but the Scots were distinct from the
                Irish, as much of their culture was home-grown and specific to their needs as Scotsmen.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                These groups were formidable. After Rome conquered most of Britain in the early 1st century AD, they had
                a go at the north. The Britons struggled, eventually ceding portions of land. But, the Picts and the
                Scots endured the Roman advances and counter-raided on numerous occasions. Eventually, the message got
                through. Roman Emperor Hadrian built his famous wall in 122 AD to consolidate Rome‚Äôs southern
                possessions (e.g. England), as these northern groups were far too resillient.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/HadrianWall.webp" />
                <p class="caption">Hadrian's Wall.</p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, these groups also fought amongst each other. They‚Äôd form alliances to fight off enemies, break
                these alliances to fight one another, and then recreate these alliances to fight new enemies. As a
                result, for centuries, power oscillated amongst the Picts, the Gaelic Scots, and the emerging
                Northumbrian English. It was chaos. Order only came in the mid-9th century, when Scottish leader Cin√°ed
                mac Ailp√≠n united the Picts and Scots to form the Kingdom of Alba, or Scotland. This formalised a
                singular Scottish identity across northern Britain, albeit centuries of inter-marriage and
                inter-settlement had laid the seeds.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">The unification came just in time. The Vikings began raiding, and a unified force stood
                the best chance at resisting. From about 800 to 1050 AD, the Vikings sailed off to various foreign
                lands‚Äîlike Scotland, Russia, England, and Ireland‚Äîand relentlessly pillaged everything in sight,
                demolishing villages and enslaving many. These chaps were steely and ruthless.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Vikings.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">The Vikings came in on long-boats and did damage.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">However, so were the newly-unified Scots. Whilst Viking raids were frequent, Scottish
                groups resisted. Much like the Romans, the Vikings found it difficult to breach the Scots‚Äô defences.
                They were able to plunder the Island of Iona and destroy a few monasteries, but true Viking settlement
                and damage was limited to the islands‚Äîe.g. the Isle of Man and Iona‚Äîand the far north. </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The English, however, struggled, ultimately letting the Vikings conquer ¬æ of its kingdoms after fifteen
                years of conquest. By the 11th century, the majority of England was ruled by Vikings, after successful
                expeditions by Sweyn Forkbeard and Cnut the Great. In Ireland, the Vikings destroyed most monasteries
                and enslaved many. These newly-enslaved men were then sent to Dublin, where they were sold to the
                Moors.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As the Kingdom of Alba entered the 2nd millennium, it was a uniquely Gaelic realm, populated by
                no-nonsense, gritty men. Although invaders‚Äîe.g. the Romans, Vikings and Northumbrian English‚Äîdid damage,
                the damage paled in comparison to that done to the English and the Irish. Additionally, whilst the
                Anglos, Jutes, and the Saxons dominated England during the 9th century, they struggled to assert
                themselves in the Kingdom of Alba. These disparities put the Scots in a unique position, strengthening
                their culture and identity.
            </p>


            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-2">Middle History (1025 AD - 1700 AD)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As these lads entered the later stages of the Middle Ages, external influences crept in. The Normans,
                who were prominent in England, expanded their influence. After William the Conqueror became England‚Äôs
                first Norman king in 1066, Norman settlements spread across England and, to a lesser extent, Scotland.
                King David I of Scotland (1124-1153) promoted Norman settlement by offering land and financial
                incentives.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/NormanConquest.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">In the 11th century, the Normans invaded and occupied England. Some came to Scotland.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                As a result, a sizable Anglo-Norman contingency grew, especially in Moray, Mearns, and Gowrie. As they
                did in England, they promoted feudal landholding systems, which were adopted all across the Lowlands.
                So, Scotland began to Anglicise, albeit notable distinctions remained, especially in the Highlands. The
                Highlanders resisted feudalism and stayed true to their Gaelic Scottish roots, even as James II and
                James V sought to impose their rule. Clans, kinship, and chieftains remained. Scottish kings, realising
                the futility of compulsion, were forced to negotiate with earls in the Highlands and the Islands to
                maintain their influence.

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Furthermore, as the Kingdoms of England and Scotland strengthened, their relationship became more
                strained. From the 11th century onwards, the Scots and the English quarreled over spheres of influence.
                Certain Scottish kings had peaceful relations with England‚Äîsuch as Alexander III‚Äîbut others‚Äîlike Malcolm
                III‚Äîwere more bloodthirsty, frequently raiding England‚Äôs northern posessions, like Northumberland and
                Carlisle.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The relationships between the Kingdoms' kings varied over time. Some kings were more aggressive than
                others, especially early on. In 1173, Henry II forced William the Lion into vassalage and made him give
                up castles in Edinburgh and Sterling. In 1296, John Balliol surrendered Scotland to the English,
                allowing them to tax and patrol the Scots. However, thanks to the efforts of William Wallace and Robert
                I, Scotland regained its independence in March 1328. Later, Robert I‚Äôs son married the daughter of
                Edward III, the English king, which reduced quarrels. There were still infrequent raids, mainly under
                Henry IV, but the Scots endured them, and relations remained (mostly) stable.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">In the end, England‚Äôs early meddling helped the Scots cement their unique identity. In
                the 1320 Declaration of Arbroath, written to persuade the pope to denounce England‚Äôs aggression, Robert
                I portrayed the Scots as a proud people, who were able to resist the Danes, English, and Norse, and who
                had the right to govern themselves. It didn‚Äôt work, but it strengthened the Scottish resolve, and they
                promptly won independence in 1328.
            </p>

                    subjugation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Eventually, with James VI‚Äôs ascension to the English crown in 1603, England and
                Scotland were, on paper, united, marking the Union of the Crowns. It didn‚Äôt end the tensions between the
                Scots and the English. It also did not stop internal discontent, as seen by the regular clashes between
                the Jacobite Highlanders and the Anglicised Lowlanders. But, the countries were balanced, and the 17th
                century saw an increase in productive relations.
            </p>


            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-3">Golden Era (1700 AD - 1914 AD)</h1>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, as the 18th century approached, Scotland‚Äôs situation was dire. The Scots, having seen the
                success of the British East India Company, created their own imitation‚Äîthe Darien Company‚Äîin hopes of
                replicating England‚Äôs glory. The Darien Company raised around ¬£400k, much of which came from the
                Scottish government, with the intention of colonising Panama. Unfortunately, the expeditions, which took
                place in the 1690s, failed. Famine, disease, and poor yields were rife, and the Scottish economy was
                bankrupted. Concurrently, there were poor harvests back in Scotland, causing many to starve. Scotland‚Äôs
                grave predicament, as well as bribes by the English, made many call for stronger ties to the powerful
                English. Thus, in 1707, England absorbed Scotland, and Great Britain was born.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Trade</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                But, the Union was a blessing. Although most of Scotland‚Äôs autonomy was lost‚Äîfor example, Scottish
                Parliament disappeared‚ÄîScotland‚Äôs ties to the affluent England created avenues of trade. According to
                Tom Devine, in 1758, ‚ÄúScottish tobacco imports‚Äù from America were greater than those of ‚ÄúLondon,
                Bristol, Liverpool, and Whitehaven‚Äù combined. Ireland, however, had little to no stake in the prospering
                American markets due to the Act of 1696, which was passed by the English and banned most American
                imports into Ireland. As a result, both England and Scotland held quasi-monopolies over American trade.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Tobacco.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Tobacco was a massive industry in America, and the Scots profited from it.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Similarly, the Scots dominated the West Indian sugar trade. ‚ÄúSugar princes‚Äù became
                millionaires, and organisations, such as Alexander Houstoun & Company, surged. Scotland‚Äôs economy was
                on the rise, and Glasgow, Clyde, Edinburgh, and other cities benefitted. </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Innovation</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Scotland's thriving economy was accompanied by a surge in innovation, a development rooted in the
                nation's longstanding emphasis on reading and education, driven by a desire for widespread Biblical
                literacy. The University of St. Andrews, for example, was founded early‚Äîin 1413‚Äîand was immensely
                cheaper than Oxford University and Cambridge University, meaning you didn‚Äôt need to be posh to be
                literate. University of Glasgow and Edinburgh University followed in 1451 and 1583, respectively.
                Further, the Calvinist belief in doing your best work‚Äîall the time, for the glory of God‚Äîushered the
                Scots towards self-improvement, mainly via education.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                With educated upper and middle classes, along with its booming economy, Scotland grew. Edinburgh and
                Glasgow, in particular, prospered. Their populations surged‚Äîespecially in the midst of the Industrial
                Revolution‚Äîwhich increased urban development, employment, and immigration. Eventually, immigration
                forced Edinburgh to expand, so the Edinburgh Town Council built the northern, Georgian New Town, which
                was connected to the Old Town via the North Bridge. The bridge still stands, adding to Edinburgh‚Äôs
                distinctive charm.
            </p>

                <p class="caption">Edinburgh's lovely North Bridge.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">As a result of their growth, these cities became melting pots for ideas. Many Scottish
                Enlightenment thinkers‚Äîsuch as David Hume, William Robertson, and William Ferugsson‚Äîlived close to one
                another, often crossing paths. This drove the Enlightenment, as these chaps were able to draw
                inspiration from and bounce ideas off one another. Such interactions elevated the likes of Adam Smith,
                Francis Hutcheson, Henry Peter Brougham, and Henry Home to higher levels of understanding. As a result,
                Edinburgh and Glasgow gained lofty reputations, prompting Voltaire to remark that ‚Äúit is to Scotland
                that we look for our idea of civilisation.‚Äù</p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The rest of Scotland developed, too, with roads and bridges connecting the isolated Highlands to the
                rest of Scottish society. The Caledonian Canal, for example, opened the Highlands to commercial traffic.
                Despite the controversial Highland clearances, the Scots began taking more interest in their Highlander
                heritage. Even the likes of Adam Smith and Adam Ferguson‚Äîwho, respectively, founded the modern fields of
                economics and sociology‚Äîsaw the value of the Highlanders. In particular, Smith appreciated the health
                and courage benefits associated with Highlander-esque militias. Coupled with the influence of Walter
                Scott, whose work about the Highlands increased global interest, Scotland‚Äôs tourism industry boomed.

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Impact on America</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Scottish impact extended beyond Scotland. For centuries, Protestant countries‚Äîlike Norway and
                Sweden‚Äîrelied on Highlander military support. For example, in the 17th century, Gustavus Adolphus
                recruited the military services of the Highlander Clan Munro, whose power helped transform Sweden into a
                global superpower. Further, Scots were involved in the Rotterdam stock exchange, founded in 1598.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                During the Industrial Age, Scottish influence multiplied. As mentioned earlier, the Scots shaped
                America. They arrived in the United States, bringing valuable skills and knowledge. Clyde shipbuilders,
                with their civil engineering expertise, played a key role in American engineering development. Scottish
                doctors and politicians also helped modernize the nation. In the 18th and 19th centuries, nearly 3
                million Scots emigrated to America. Notably, between 1717 and 1776, around 250,000 Ulstermen, most of
                whom had Scottish roots, made the journey.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">

            </div>


            <p class="paragraph">One of Scotland‚Äôs most important influences, though, was education. Many American
                universities‚Äîlike Princeton, William & Mary, Columbia, and Brown‚Äîwere influenced by Scottish education.
                In particular, Princeton had a deep connection to the Scots, having been (partially) founded by
                Ulsterman Samuel Blair. Many of its early presidents were Scottish. One of them, John Witherspoon,
                modelled its curriculum off Edinburgh University. Later, James McCosh founded the graduate school and
                schools of science, and erected numerous buildings around campus.

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Scottish investment was also omnipresent. The Scottish government invested millions
                into American railroads. In addition, Scottish entrepreneurs boosted the United States‚Äôs economy. Andrew
                Carnegie, for example, founded the Carnegie Steel Company and employed tens-of-thousands. When J.P.
                Morgan bought the company in the early 20th century, Carnegie became one of the richest men ever and
                proceeded to construct pools, auditoriums, libraries, etc., all over the country.</p>

            <p class="paragraph">All in all, the Scots were key to America‚Äôs development. Whilst many were proud of
                their Scottish heritage, they quickly assimilated and attached to the American identity, partially why
                people are unaware of Scotland‚Äôs impact on America. The Irish, on the other hand, maintained their links
                to Ireland, establishing large Irish communities (e.g. Philadelphia and Boston) and bringing over Irish
                politics, as seen by the Orange Riots of 1870 and 1871. Coupled with their poor living conditions‚Äîmany
                lived in ghettoes‚Äîand lack of education, anti-Irish sentiment was, unfortunately, rife. The mistreatment
                of the Irish in the North was even used by Southerners to defend slavery, as they argued that slaves
                were treated better in the South.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Empire Builders</h1>

            <p class="paragraph">Beyond America, the Scots were crucial for the British Empire, helping consolidate its
                holdings. After the Revolutionary War, the British were weak. Despite incredible naval power, and the
                deployment of Highlanders, they‚Äôd lost their richest colony. Further, British loyalists were bombed-out
                of the United States, fleeing to Canada. All in all, they looked like jokes. However, 30 years after the
                Revolutionary War, Britain became Europe‚Äôs most powerful state. How did Britain undergo such a
                remarkable turnaround? You know the answer.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                After losing America, the Brits consolidated their holdings in Canada. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC)
                and the Northwest Company (NWC) heightened their dominance over the fur trade. The HBC‚Äîrun by Sir George
                Simpson, a Highlander from Ross-shire‚Äîgrew to trade across ‚Äú3 million square miles of territory.‚Äù
                Incredible. The HBC and the NWC employed loads of Scots, often from the Orkney Islands, as these chaps
                were gritty enough to survive in Canada‚Äôs unforgiving cold; they also employed the services of the
                loyalist Highlanders. With Scottish influence, these companies helped turn Montreal and Halifax into
                prosperous trading centres.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Also, Scottish muscle helped the British defeat the French in Trafalgar and Waterloo.
                By finishing the belligerent Napoleon, the Empire cemented itself as Europe‚Äôs strongest state. Further
                victories‚Äîsuch as in the 1840 Opium War, a war started by Scottish opium traders‚Äîwere backed by Scottish
                muscle and ingenuity, with John Laird‚Äôs iron ships playing a key role in demolishing opposition.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After these battles, Scottish regiments, like the 42nd (Royal Highland) Regiment,
                received heroes‚Äô welcomes. To commemorate their bravery, citizens created graffiti, songs, and symbols.
                However, this was nothing new. For example, in Ulster, a country comprised of ethnic Scots, people had
                been memoralising the Siege of Derry for years. In later years, the 36th (Ulster) Division‚Äôs efforts in
                Somme were treated similarly. All in all, the Scots are a proud people. It is imperative to stand up for
                what‚Äôs right, make sacrifices, and fight back against oppressors, as the Romans and Vikings can attest.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Further, the Scots helped urbanise Australia. Originally, Australia was a country
                dominated by uncouth, violent prisoners, but the Scots helped modernise it. One of Australia‚Äôs early
                politicians, the Hebridean Lachlan Macquarie, built schools, roads, and churches, which boosted
                education, development, and prosperity. Further, as the Empire accumulated more-and-more land, sheep
                farming became a massive industry, with Scottish entrepreneurs cashing in. Unfortunately, much of this
                land was at the expense of the Aboriginals, who were massacred by disease and hostilities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Scottish influence was largely positive, though, and Scots migrated with good
                intentions. By the early 1800s, they started exploring Africa. Expeditions were spurred on by ministers,
                like Thomas Chalmers, who urged people to spread Christianity for philanthropic purposes. Macgregor
                Laird and David Livingstone were receptive to this call-to-arms and went off on expeditions. Few had
                explored central and western Africa before, as many believed it to be a disease-ridden, violent place,
                but Livingstone proved them wrong.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Livingstone spent decades in Africa, fighting tigers, malaria, and (initially) hostile
                populations. His persistence paid off, and he assimilated. He converted many to Christianity, modernised
                towns, and brought wealth. After spending time in African communities, he came to despise the slave
                trade. To combat Arabic slave traders, he armed African chiefs and encouraged trade among the chiefdoms
                to reduce their reliance on the slave trade. However, in 1873, he succumbed to malaria.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">His legacy influenced the European ‚ÄúScramble for Africa‚Äù in the 19th century. But, many
                Africans appreciated his efforts. Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda called him the ‚Äúfirst freedom
                fighter,‚Äù and various African cities have kept the names he gave them‚Äîsuch as Malawi‚Äôs Livingstonia and
                Blantyre, and Zambia‚Äôs Livingstone.

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-4">Decline and Modern Period (1914 AD - Present)</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                However, Scotland began declining after World War I, as centuries of emigration dwindled its pool of
                skilled workers, hurting domestic industries. Despite progress via the National Services Scotland (NHS),
                television, and improved housing, low wages drove emigration to places like Australia, England, Jamaica,
                and, surprisingly, Eastern Europe, where Scots have an interesting history‚Äîfrom 1691 to 1703, Aberdonian
                Alexander Chalmers served four terms as mayor of Warsaw. Between 1951 and 1981 alone, over 753,000 Scots
                emigrated, nearly half of them to England.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Further, Scotland‚Äôs domestic industries took a nosedive, and not just because of the dwindling
                workforce. Barring temporary rises during World War 1 & 2, the global demand for jute, coal, and ships
                declined, hurting places like Clyde and Dundee. The increase in tertiary work‚Äîthe services sector‚Äîalso
                propelled the decline, hurting the agricultural and industrial industries. It wasn‚Äôt just Scotland
                though; various countries felt the decline. It even pushed Yugoslavia to its violent break-up.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">After World War II, Scotland shifted away from traditional industries, leading to
                widespread factory closures and job losses. Labour governments stepped in to ease this transition,
                working with unions and providing grants to companies like Chrysler UK and Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.
                Their goal was to safeguard the economic security of working-class families, aiming to reduce the impact
                of industrial decline on local communities and create new opportunities.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">However, under the Conservative tutelage of Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher,
                deindustrialisation accelerated. Edward Heath minimised state support for Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, and
                Thatcher notoriously waged war against unions and encouraged privatisation. Following closures in Timex
                plants, Dundee lost 1,675 industrial jobs. Also, after the closure of a massive car plant in Linwood in
                1981, over 4,800 workers were made redundant. Within the span of a century, prospering cities had turned
                into bastions of unemployment and poverty.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">

                <p class="caption">Working men and women, protesting against rapid deindustrialisation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">The Linwood closure underscored a significant trend during Thatcher's neoliberal era:
                privatised companies shuttered and relocated, impacting thousands. By 1971, Glasgow's shipbuilding
                workforce had dwindled to around 11,000, just 10% of its Edwardian peak. Despite sit-ins and work-ins,
                like those at Clydeside in the '60s and '70s, deindustrialization persisted. Conservative support for
                deindustrialisation spurred the Scottish National Party's rise and the Conservative Party's decline,
                while Anglophobia grew, as London-based decision-makers (‚Äúfaceless men‚Äù) became targets of resentment.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">These days, poverty and unemployment persist. From 2014 to 2017, approximately one
                million Scots, including around 230,000 children, were living in poverty. Many, particularly in the
                Scottish Labour Party, attributed this to UK government cuts and placed the blame on the Tories. After a
                brief decline, child poverty has been rising in recent years. Although relative poverty had been
                decreasing since 1995, it started increasing again, reaching 24% in 2023, mainly due to the impacts of
                COVID-19.

            <p class="paragraph">As for what the near future holds: who knows. We‚Äôre living in strange, strange times,
                and change takes ages. But, the Scots have bounced back from worse, so I have faith in them. They
                have far too much knowledge, steel, and spirit. If anyone can bring about such a drastic and positive
                change, it's the Scots. Eventually, they‚Äôll be back.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, onto football.
            </p>


            <h1 class="section-leader-title" id="section-b">Football</h1>
            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-5">Overview</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I had written a long, drawn-out draft, but sod it. I‚Äôll keep it simple: the Scots love their football.
                Much like the English, they had an early start. The Factory Acts of the mid-19th century freed up time
                for the working class, which encouraged the creation of football clubs. Queen‚Äôs Park was founded in
                1867, Rangers in 1872, and Hibernian in 1875. A bunch of others‚ÄîHearts in 1874, Celtic in 1887, and
                Cowdenbeath in 1881‚Äîfollowed, and the game became popular.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Again, like the English, much of the game‚Äôs early discourse was dominated by the debate over
                professionalism, e.g. whether the game should be sullied by player wages. Queen‚Äôs Park drove the amateur
                initiative, whilst various others supported professionalism. Eventually, the English meddled (as per)
                and concluded the debate; they began luring talented Scottish footballers to England with hefty wage
                packets. To plug the talent drain, the Scots legalised professionalism in 1893.

            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Quickly, Scottish football became a duopoly of Rangers and Celtic. Celtic were founded
                in 1887 by Brother Walfrid, headmaster of St. Andrew‚Äôs School, as well as builder John Glass and doctor
                John Conway. Celtic‚Äôs early goal was to raise money for the Catholic poor in Glasgow‚Äôs East End. Many
                Irishmen lived in the East End, after heavy migration following the potato famine of the 1840s. It was a
                ghetto, struck by disease, poverty, and epidemics. To provide support, Celtic would play invitation
                matches, donate to charities, and host dinners. It was a popular club, with arguably the biggest support
                in Britain by 1900. Celtic's stadium, Parkhead, was built by volunteer supporters, demonstrating the
                strong connection between the club and its fans.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Rangers were founded in 1872 by 4 teenage boys, looking for a jolly. Unlike Celtic, Rangers were
                nomadic. The club moved around plenty, from Burnbank, to Kinning Park, to Ibrox, all within its first 3
                decades of existence. But, this nomadism secured them a large, widespread fanbase. Unlike Celtic,
                Rangers weren‚Äôt explicitly founded for religious reasons, although they quickly became known as a
                Protestant football club. Most of Rangers‚Äôs players, managers, and board members were Protestant, and
                Ibrox was filled with masonic imagery, with the chequered flooring and pillars resembling King Solomon's
                Temple.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Ninety-five percent of Scottish football history is marked by alternating periods of dominance between
                Celtic and Rangers. For example: Rangers won 4 league titles in a row from 1899 to 1902. Immediately
                after, from 1904 to 1910, Celtic won 6 league titles, along with 5 Scottish Cups from 1904 to 1912. I
                could copy-and-paste these two sentences another 6 times, altering the dates and trophy quantities, and
                I‚Äôll have produced an accurate history of Scottish football. But I‚Äôll keep it simple. After Celtic‚Äôs
                6-in-a-row, during the inter-war period, Rangers won 14 titles. Their dominance continued after World
                War Two, albeit Hearts and Hibernian had good runs, until Jock Stein joined Celtic in 1965. Stein won 10
                titles in 13 years, including 9-in-a-row from 1966-1974.

            <p class="paragraph">
                1960 to 1984 was the Golden Age of Scottish football. Not only were Celtic a threat domestically, but
                they also did bits in Europe. In 1967, they won the European Cup in Lisbon, beating Helenio Herrera‚Äôs
                famous Grande Inter. Celtic‚Äôs side, all of whom were born within 30 miles of Celtic Park, were then
                dubbed the ‚ÄúLisbon Lions.‚Äù They were the first British side to win the European Cup, and remain the only
                Scottish side to do so. Celtic also made the final in 1970 and the semi-finals in 1972 and 1974. During
                the '60s and '70s, they were one of Europe‚Äôs finest sides.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Rangers, however, struggled in the European Cup. Their best chance was in 1965, when they lost to Inter
                Milan in the quarter-finals. Their best player, Jim Baxter, had his leg broken earlier in the season,
                which screwed their chances. But, Rangers did bits in the Cup Winners‚Äô Cup: they won the competition in
                1972, and made the final in both 1967 and 1961. Unfortunately, they played the 1967 final a few days
                after Celtic had won the European Cup. Since Celtic are Rangers‚Äôs bogeyman, the players were distracted,
                so they lost to the glamorous Bayern Munich.

                For Celtic and Rangers, that was as far as they‚Äôd go. In the late 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs, Dundee United and
                Aberdeen rose. Ferguson came into a poor Aberdeen side, turned the likes of Alex McLeish, Gordon
                Strachan, and Willie Miller into top footballers, and won the league 3 times. Jim McClean, along with
                assistant Walter Smith, won the league in 1983, as well as the League Cup in 1980 and 1981. Not only did
                these sides (temporarily) break the Old Firm duopoly, but they had great runs in Europe. In 1983, Alex
                Ferguson‚Äôs Aberdeen beat Real Madrid in the Cup Winners‚Äô Cup final. An incredible accomplishment. Dundee
                United also made the European Cup semi-final in 1984, unjustly losing to a cheating Roma side. 3 years
                later, they made the UEFA Cup final, narrowly losing to a strong IFK G√∂teborg.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Additionally, during this time, Scottish footballers were incredible. Denis Law revived Manchester
                United after Munich, winning the FA Cup, two First Division titles, and the European Cup, as well as
                bagging the Ballon D‚Äôor for himself in 1964. Kenny Dalglish arrested Celtic‚Äôs decline and later became
                Liverpool‚Äôs best ever footballer. He was the head of Liverpool‚Äôs feared Scottish triumvirate‚Äîhim, Graeme
                Souness, and Alan Hansen. These 3 lads were world-class footballers, and, together, won 5 First Division
                titles and 3 European Cups. For Leeds United, Billy Bremner, Eddie Gray, and Peter Lorimer were crucial.
                With these two, Leeds won 2 First Division titles, an FA Cup, and 2 UEFA Cups, and they also finished
                runners-up in the European Cup. I could go on-an-on with other sides, e.g. MacKay, Brown, and White‚Äôs
                Spurs, or Robertson, Burns, and O‚ÄôHare‚Äôs Forest.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Unfortunately, none of the individual quality translated to international success. In his book, Colin
                Bell, Manchester City‚Äôs greatest footballer (1963‚Äì1979), remarked that Scotland‚Äôs failures shocked him,
                as they had great, great players. He was right. As seen above, the Scots were class. During Bell‚Äôs time
                especially, the Scots were unparalleled. They had Dave Mackay, Denis Law, Billy Bremner, Jim Baxter,
                Billy McNeill, and Willie Johnston, as well as various other mavericks, but they didn‚Äôt qualify for a
                single World Cup or European Championship. Scotland were bottlers, no question about that.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Beyond on-pitch performances, everything surrounding the national team was shocking. The Scottish
                Football Association (SFA) were toxic. The likes of Paddy Crerand and Jimmy Johnstone said that the SFA
                were heavily pro-Rangers, to the point where any Rangers player on a decent run of form would be
                guaranteed a call-up. Beyond the SFA, the Tartan Army were also predominantly Rangers supporters.
                Johnstone, voted Celtic‚Äôs best ever player, said he wasn‚Äôt entirely comfortable playing for Scotland,
                because ‚Äúhis‚Äù supporters would give him dog‚Äôs abuse and call for Willie Henderson, a Rangers player, to
                take his place. Celtic‚Äôs Bobby Lennox, a world-class footballer, only got 10 caps for Scotland, whereas
                David Hay was also jeered for displacing Rangers‚Äôs Sandy Jardine.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Further, the Scottish media killed anyone who played in England, dubbing them ‚ÄúAnglos.‚Äù Mackay, Law,
                Gilzean, Crerand, and McLintock all got it at points, but Law had it worst. When Scotland drew 2-2 with
                England in 1965, and Ian McColl lost his job, Denis Law was ruthlessly slandered in the media, despite
                scoring Scotland‚Äôs first. He didn‚Äôt play when Scotland had beat Italy 1-0 later that year, which, in the
                minds of the media, vindicated their rancor. If Scotland‚Äôs best ever footballer was getting stick, then
                that tells you everything you need to know.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Similarly, club football was‚Äîand still is‚Äîa cesspit. As mentioned earlier, Celtic are a Catholic club
                and Rangers a Protestant one. These two also happen to be the biggest clubs in Scotland. You can
                probably imagine how clashes between the two go. It's relentless alcohol consumption, sectarian
                conflict, brawls, parcel bombs, and general violence. Celtic, to be fair, aren‚Äôt discriminatory. Two of
                their best ever players, Kenny Dalglish and Danny McGrain, are Protestant, as was Jock Stein, the club‚Äôs
                greatest manager.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Rangers, however, operated under an infamous anti-Catholic policy for more than a century. In 1912,
                Ulster-based shipbuilding company Harland and Wolff loaned Rangers ¬£90,000. Harland and Wolff was
                crucial to Belfast‚Äôs economy, but they were known for their blatant sectarian policies. Their peak
                employment was more than 30,000 men, with only a couple hundred being Catholics. One of the loan‚Äôs
                stipulations was that Rangers remain Catholic-free, as they had been for (most of) their existence.
                Ralph Brand, Rangers player from 1954 to 1965, exposed the club after his departure, clueing everyone in
                on the world‚Äôs worst kept secret. He also lambasted the club for its ‚ÄúIron Curtain‚Äù-esque policies,
                where nobody affiliated with Rangers was allowed to mention the club‚Äôs policy; the club operated under
                an omert√†. (Reading his quotes, you‚Äôd think the club were the Mafia!)
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The policy was broken when Graeme Souness controversially signed the Catholic, ex-Celtic Mo Johnston in
                1989. Even then, that didn‚Äôt stop the sectarian feeling throughout the club. Immediately, many Rangers
                fans gave up their season tickets, and effigies of Souness were burned in Ulster. Both Johnston and
                Souness had to be followed by security for six months. Terry Butcher says that Rangers‚Äôs kitman
                discriminated against Johnston, and a few of his teammates didn‚Äôt sit with him during meal-times.
                Shocking. And it hasn‚Äôt died down, either. As recently as 2019, Rangers received a stadium ban for
                sectarian chants against Gibraltar-based St Joseph‚Äôs.
            </p>
            <div class="picture-caption-container">

                <p class="caption">Graeme Souness and Mo Johnston. One of the most controversial signings in

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                It‚Äôs not just the fans. As said above, Rangers players partook in the discrimination whilst Johnston was
                at the club. It was consistent with Rangers‚Äôs history. Some of the club‚Äôs most important figures‚ÄîAndy
                Goram, Bill Struth, etc.‚Äîencouraged sectarian nonsense. For one, Goram was photographed with an Ulster
                Volunteer Force (UVF) flag. For the uninitiated, the UVF were a paramilitary group in Northern Ireland,
                responsible for killing hundreds of Catholic civilians and escalating the Troubles from the 1960s to the
                1990s. Beyond that, he wore a black armband‚Äîtraditionally worn when someone‚Äôs in mourning‚Äîafter the
                death of Billy Wright, a UVF member who carried out many brutal murders. Most of the club‚Äôs legendary
                figures were culpable.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Overall, the Old Firm derby is nasty. Some praise its high-octane, emotional nature,
                but it‚Äôs hard to look past all the discrimination, sectarianism, paranoia, and violence. Whilst they
                played for the clubs, Ian Wright, Terry Butcher, Chris Woods, and Ray Wilkins, amongst other Englishmen,
                were all surprised at how intense and hateful the rivalry was. Graeme Souness, who‚Äôs effectively an
                Anglo, had to quit the job after 5 years, because of all the stress that came with being Rangers‚Äôs
                manager. There‚Äôs nothing like it in England, and (arguably) nothing like it on the continent. You‚Äôd have
                to go to South America to find anything comparable. I think only the Supercl√°sico (Boca Juniors vs.
                River Plate) outdoes the Old Firm.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Anyway. These days, Scottish football‚Äôs in a dire state. After strong stints in the 90s
                and 2000s, when Rangers were outspending every side in Britain, it‚Äôs taken a steep decline. Celtic
                reached the Europa League final in 2003, and Rangers in both 2008 and 2022, but European success has
                remained non-existent. In 2017, Rangers lost 2-0 to Luxembourg-based Progr√®s Niederkorn, which was
                described as the club‚Äôs most embarrassing result ever. The year before, Celtic lost 1-0 to Gibraltar‚Äôs
                Lincoln Red Imps. Compared to Scotland‚Äôs heights in 1967, 1972, and 1983, the game‚Äôs clearly shriveled.

                <p class="caption">Celtic players after they lost 1-0 to a Gibraltar-based side. One of the most

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Why is this? For one, the funding. The Scots receive maybe 5% of the TV money that the English receive,
                so they can‚Äôt compete with their neighbours. A mid-table Championship side has comparable spending power
                to Celtic and Rangers. Further, Edinburgh-based Hearts and Hibernian, both big football clubs, have had
                discussions over merging due to their perilous finances. It‚Äôs a sad state. Massive, historic clubs are
                being left behind.

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Secondly, Rangers underwent administration in 2012 after two decades of lavish spending. Like Portsmouth
                and Leeds, they gambled on future success with foreign, extravagant signings‚Äîlike Brian Laudrup, Paul
                Gascoigne, Tore Andr√© Flo, and Gennaro Gattuso‚Äîbut they won nowt in Europe. In fact, most of the time,
                they were cannon fodder, receiving beatings from giants like Barcelona, United, Ajax, AEK Athens, and
                Grasshoppers. After Rangers‚Äôs administration, Scottish football weakened. No longer was the Scottish
                League a duopoly; Celtic could walk their way to the title. Good for their trophy cabinet, but poor for
                their endeavours against European opposition.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Thirdly, there‚Äôs been a sharp decrease in player quality. Scotland regularly produced world-class
                footballers from the 1950s to the late 1980s, but it has dried up the last few decades. Whilst the
                current Scottish squad are decent, they don‚Äôt compare to sides of the past. I love McTominay, but he
                doesn‚Äôt compare to Bremner or McStay. Ryan Christie is also good, but would he get a game over John
                Robertson, Jim Baxter, or Gordon Strachan? I don‚Äôt think so. The Scottish League‚Äôs declining quality
                plays a large role in this, because young Scottish talent aren‚Äôt facing challenging opposition, so they
                stagnate.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                But, in recent times, there have been positive signs. Rangers are back in the Scottish League. In 2022,
                10 years after being wound up, they made the Europa League final, only losing on penalties. Motherwell,
                Aberdeen, and Hearts have improved in recent times, with Motherwell having finished runners-up in the
                Scottish League in both 2013 and 2014. Celtic remain strong in the domestic realm, albeit they get boyed
                off in the Champions League. But things look decent. I don‚Äôt know where they go from here, but the Scots
                are not a million miles off. Perhaps they find their own Rupert Murdoch, who revives interest in the
                game and puts in millions. The English game was in an embarrassing state prior to Sky‚Äôs money, so it‚Äôs
                not implausible, especially when you consider the size of Celtic and Rangers. But who knows. In the end,
                I hope things go well for the Scots.

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-6">Early English Football</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Scots shaped the landscape of English football.
                Perthshire‚Äôs William McGregor spearheaded the formation of the Football League's First Division in 1888
                and became Aston Villa‚Äôs first president. Further, Villa‚Äôs first manager, George Ramsay, was a Scot, and
                he managed the club for 40 years. He won 6 FA Cups and 6 First Division titles. In the FA Cup, he
                finished runners-up twice; in the First Division, 6 times. Villa‚Äôs dominance during this period made
                them one of England‚Äôs biggest football clubs. Only 71 years later, under the tutelage of Ron Saunders
                and Tony Barton, did Villa reach similar heights. That side had plenty of Scots too, such as Ken
                McNaught, Allan Evans, and Des Bremner. In honour of Villa‚Äôs Scottish roots, their crest displays the
                Scottish lion.

            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Blackburn were another club that waited ages before replicating their pre-War successes. Between 1914
                and 1994, Blackburn were cack, barring an FA Cup win in 1928. Only when Jack Walker began pouring in his
                millions, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, did Blackburn resurge. They won the Premier League in 1995,
                with Alan Shearer and Chris Sutton leading the way. However, this success did not match that of their
                dominant pre-World War One era. They won the FA Cup 3 times in a row from 1884 to 1886 with a squad of
                Scots, namely Jimmy Forrest, Jimmy Douglas, and Fergus Suter. Then, the Doonhamer Thomas Mitchell took
                charge in 1887 and won the FA Cup two more times in 1890 and 1891, with plenty of Scottish talent,
                taking advantage of Scottish football‚Äôs amateurism.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Blackburn weren‚Äôt the only club to lure the Scots in. Preston North End brought in
                players like Jimmy Ross, George Drummond, and John Gordon, who led them to a historic Double and an
                undefeated season in 1888-89. Similarly, Sunderland, established by Scotsman James Allan, signed John
                Auld, William Gibson, and Jimmy Millar, clinching the league title in 1892, 1893, and 1895. Other
                northern clubs, including Manchester United and Liverpool, also tapped into Scottish prowess. Liverpool
                secured their first First Division title in 1901 under the captaincy of Scotsman Alex Raisbeck. Finally,
                the Scots spearheaded Newcastle United‚Äôs golden era, in which they won 3 FA Cups and 4 First Division
                Titles. Hughie Gallacher was the most popular, but Frank Watt, Jimmy Lawrence, and Tommy McDonald were
                also incredible.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Beyond the North, the Scots also drove football in the South. John Cameron led Tottenham Hotspur to
                their first major trophy, the 1901 FA Cup. Chelsea benefited from the long-term coaching of David
                Calderhead and the design expertise of Archibald Leitch, who built Stamford Bridge. Leitch also helped
                build White Hart Lane, West Ham Stadium, Old Trafford, Ibrox Park, and Goodison Park. Further, Arsenal‚Äôs
                rise was largely due to Scottish playmaker Alex James, whose creativity secured their first major
                trophy, the 1930 FA Cup, and initiated a run of four league titles. All in all, in the early days, the
                Scots did plenty for English football.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Their work continued after World War Two. Manchester United, for one, would be nothing
                without Matt Busby. When Busby came into the club, Old Trafford was in tatters, having been bombed by
                the Nazis, and the club had just come off of a 20-year period of mediocrity. Through his steel, bravery,
                and wisdom, he turned it around. During Busby‚Äôs 24-year reign, United won 5 First Division titles, 2 FA
                Cups, and the European Cup. His Scottish stalwarts, like Denis Law, Paddy Crerand, and David Herd, were
                key to establishing United as England‚Äôs greatest club.

            <p class="paragraph">Most importantly, Busby rebuilt the club twice. First, after World War Two; second,
                after half the squad had died in the 1958 Munich disaster. There‚Äôs plenty that I could write here‚Äîabout
                Busby‚Äôs youth policy, the work of Louis Rocca and Jimmy Murphy, the aftermaths of the disaster, and how
                Busby rebuilt the side‚Äîbut I‚Äôll keep it short: Busby is the greatest figure in Manchester United's
                history. The only person that comes close is Sir Alex Ferguson, another legendary Scotsman.

                Spurs were another side transformed by Scots. After their 1951 First Divison triumph, they trailed off,
                becoming an inconsistent cup team. They had talent, but they lacked backbone and consistency. Only when
                Dave Mackay joined in 1959 did Spurs put everything together. They won the Double in 1961, as well as
                two further FA Cup victories in 1962 and 1967. Further, they won the Cup Winners‚Äô Cup in 1963, becoming
                the first English side to win a European trophy. Mackay‚Äôs fellow Scots, John White and Bill Brown, were
                key to Spurs‚Äôs successes. Unfortunately, after Mackay broke his leg twice, and after John White got
                killed by lightning, Spurs began languishing. But, the signing of Dundee‚Äôs Alan Gilzean arrested their
                decline, and they won a further 3 trophies, including the 1972 UEFA Cup. Since then, Spurs have bagged
                the occasional cup trophy, but they‚Äôve struggled to reach their heights of the ‚Äò60s and ‚Äò70s.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Liverpool, like Spurs, were transformed by a Scot. For the longest time, Everton were the biggest team
                in Merseyside, especially in 1959, when Bill Shankly arrived at Liverpool. They had won 2 FA Cup
                trophies and 5 First Division titles and were one of England‚Äôs biggest clubs, dwarfing the inconsistent
                Liverpool. Shankly changed that. He took Liverpool out of the Second Division, won 3 First Division
                titles, 2 FA Cups, and the UEFA Cup. He also took Liverpool to the European Cup semi-final in 1965,
                barely losing to Inter. His Scottish players‚ÄîRon Yeats, Ian St. John, Billy Liddell, Peter Cormack, and
                Tommy Lawrence‚Äîwere all key to Liverpool‚Äôs successes at various times. By the time he left in 1974,
                Liverpool were one of England‚Äôs greatest football clubs. His successor, Bob Paisley, carried the mantle
                and pushed Liverpool to new heights, winning more First Division titles and bagging 3 European Cups. As
                mentioned earlier, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, and Graeme Souness were all key to Paisley‚Äôs success.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">I can write more. Leeds had plenty of Scots, like Bremner, Gray, and Lorimer, as did
                Clough‚Äôs Forest. Basically, if you look at any club‚Äôs golden era, you‚Äôll find plenty of Scots driving
                the success, whether as manager or as superstar footballers.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Unfortunately, in recent times, the Scots are less prevalent. The relationship between
                England and Scotland has changed. Instead of English clubs bringing in superior Scottish talent to drive
                success, it‚Äôs the opposite. Celtic owe much of their current success to imports from England, like Scott
                Sinclair, Moussa Demb√©l√©, and Leigh Griffiths. Rangers are similar, with John Lundstram, Ryan Kent,
                Connor Goldson, and James Tavernier thriving in Scotland after being unable to hack it in England.
                Meanwhile, English sides increasingly looking overseas for talent. Currently, Manchester City and
                Arsenal have 0 Scottish footballers. Both United and Liverpool only have 1. Shocking, considering their
                histories.

                But, all in all, the Scots have a great legacy in England. Whilst it hasn‚Äôt continued into the modern
                era, the Scots built many English clubs and pushed them to great success. These days, whilst the likes
                of Robertson and McTominay have helped their clubs reach finals and win trophies, it‚Äôs not the same. If
                the Scottish League becomes more competitive and wealthy, and players begin playing in a more difficult
                environment, then maybe English clubs will start drawing on their northern neighbours again. But, as for
                now, the Scots are being marginalised.

            <p class="paragraph">
                This year, Scotland‚Äôs biggest competitors are England, Spain, Germany, and Portugal. Some would put
                Italy, Holland, and Belgium into that list, but I‚Äôm not going to. Whilst those sides have pockets of
                talent, I don‚Äôt rate their depth. For example, look at Belgium. They‚Äôve got Kevin de Bruyne, a magician.
                But, simultaneously, they rely on Romelu Lukaku, a serial bottlejob, to lead their attack. He nullifies
                De Bruyne‚Äôs quality. Belgium have also lost incredible footballers‚Äîlike Vertonghen, Alderweireld,
                Nainggolan, and Hazard‚Äîin recent years. As a result, I don‚Äôt rate their chances. They‚Äôre top-heavy.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/LukakuVandalised.webp" />
                <p class="caption">A vandalised Romelu Lukaku mural, after he pushed for a move to Juventus.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">But, top-heaviness is not always an issue. Sir Alex Ferguson once claimed that he could
                win the European Cup with Zinedine Zidane and 10 planks of wood. But De Bruyne is no Zidane. He doesn‚Äôt
                have Zizou‚Äôs grace. Obviously he‚Äôs a world-class footballer, but everything about him is mechanical: the
                dribbling, passing, etc. There is no rawness to his game. He‚Äôs like a robot: everything‚Äôs refined and
                manufactured; there are no rough edges, none of the imperfections that drew people to the likes of
                Thierry Henry, G√ºnter Netzer, and George Best. You need some rawness to your game, a burst of
                spontaneity, or else you become predictable. Unfortunately, he has none.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">But, his refined state suits him: he plays for Manchester City. Just like how De Bruyne
                is a manufactured footballer, City are a manufactured football club. Neither have impurities; there‚Äôs no
                risk of jeopardy. Ergo, there‚Äôs no glory in either of their accomplishments. So, if Belgium win the
                Euros off the back of De Bruyne‚Äôs quality, it‚Äôll mean nothing. Effectively, they‚Äôre not contenders.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As for Italy, I think they have decent depth. But, they‚Äôve weakened since their 2021
                triumph, with Jorginho, Chiesa, and Bonucci having declined; also, Chiellini has retired. These are big
                losses. With this much degradation, it‚Äôs hard to say Italy have a chance.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Finally, Holland have great players, such as Van Dijk, de Jong, and de Ligt. But, like Belgium, their
                attack is spearheaded by a dilettante: Memphis Depay. As a United supporter, I know all about Memphis
                Depay. His attitude is shocking. Whilst at United, instead of learning to beat a defender or pass the
                football, he sulked and clashed with the media. He showed no inclination towards improving or trying to
                make it work at United. Instead, he wanted to look flash. He bought himself an all-black
                Mercedes G-Wagon, with ‚ÄúM7‚Äù emblazoned on its headrests. Nauseating.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">When Cristiano Ronaldo had originally signed for United, he immediately multiplied his
                previous efforts, understanding that he still had a long way to go. His attitude was spot-on. Like
                Mikhail Gorbachev once said, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt move forward, sooner or later you begin to move backward."
                Depay moved backward. He was happy to take his foot off the accelerator, shift his priorities, and
                indulge in customised headrests. Hence, he was quickly bombed-out of United. Since then, he has only
                succeeded at one club: Lyon (where, still, he won no trophies). He was poor at Barcelona, and he‚Äôs
                hardly impressed for Atletico. I wish him the best, but he‚Äôs not the one to lead Holland to success.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Now, onto the top sides. England are strong. I think Kane, Bellingham, Foden, and Alexander-Arnold are
                world-class, and that Saka, Rashford, Rice, and Stones are great. Off squad quality alone, they are
                easily the favourites. However, when it comes to the Auld Rivalry, squad quality goes out the window.
                Emotions triumph, and the Scottish fans and footballers raise their game. As a result, Scotland fair
                well against the Auld Enemy. These days, Scotland rarely get battered by England; it‚Äôs unlikely there‚Äôll
                be another 9-3. If the two sides meet, I reckon it‚Äôll be a slugfest, with McTominay scoring the winner.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">As for the Iberian Peninsula, Spain have a great squad. Oyarzabal, Rodri, Grimaldo,
                Carvajal, and Merino are all class. Spain won the Nations League in 2023 and dominated their Euro
                Qualifiers, even beating Scotland in Spain. However, the Scottish won the reverse fixture in Glasgow,
                with an inspired McTominay scoring a double. Another side that are good, but not miles ahead of
                Scotland. If the Scottish players‚Äô attitudes are spot-on, then they have a great chance to beat Spain.

            <p class="paragraph">Portugal are also great. They won all 10 of their Euro Qualifiers, smashing the likes
                of Bosnia and Luxembourg in the process. However, as Slovenia proved in March, these lads aren‚Äôt
                infallible. Portugal regularly field geriatrics and immobiles‚ÄîRonaldo, William Carvalho, Pepe, and
                Danilo Pereira being prime examples. It‚Äôs fine to field one or two‚ÄîFrance had Giroud in 2018‚Äîbut when
                you field five or six, it‚Äôs a big, big problem.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Part of Spain‚Äôs issue in 2014 was that they were too slow and stiff. Xavi, Iniesta,
                Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Busquets, David Villa were all incredible footballers, but in 2014, most of them
                were immobile. As a result, they got boyed off in the group stage. Against Holland, Robben had free rein
                to sprint around and take the piss. As a result, Holland won 5-1, and Spain were on an early flight
                home.
                If they had younger, mobile lads on the pitch, that wouldn‚Äôt have happened.
            </p>

                </p>
            </div>


            <p class="paragraph">
                If Portugal surrounds Ronaldo and Pepe with younger, faster players, like R√∫ben Dias, Bruno Fernandes,
                Rafael Le√£o, and Bernardo Silva, they have a good chance of succeeding. However, Portugal are amongst
                the
                biggest bottlers in world football. Outside of their 1966 World Cup run and Euro 2016 victory, they've
                historically underperformed. In 1986, they finished bottom of their World Cup group, albeit they beat
                England. In their ranks, they had the likes Jo√£o Pinto, Manuel Bento, Paulo Futre, and Fernando Gomes;
                they
                should‚Äôve cruised to the quarter-finals, at the very least. Instead, internal strife led to poor
                performance, prompting the Portuguese Parliament to intervene and restore order to the squad. It made
                France‚Äôs 2010 debacle look minor. Further, from 1970 and 1998, Portugal only made the World Cup once.
                While their current team is strong, history often repeats itself. And, with Roberto Mart√≠nez at the
                helm, it
                probably will.
            </p>
            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Football's Decline</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">All in all, I don‚Äôt rate many international sides. I think that football has declined
                massively the last decade-and-a-half. For example, look at Italy‚Äôs 2006 World Cup squad. It‚Äôs filled
                with footballing royalty: Luca Toni, Fabio Cannavaro, Gennaro Gattuso, Alessandro Del Piero, Mauro
                Camoranesi, Filippo Inzaghi, Andrea Pirlo, Francesco Totti, Gianluigi Buffon. I don‚Äôt think any of
                Italy‚Äôs players today gets into that squad.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">

                <p class="caption">Italy's 2006 squad. What a side.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Further, Spain‚Äôs 2010 squad: Iker Casillas, Xabi Alonso, Xavi, Iniesta, Fernando
                Torres, Sergio Ramos, David Villa. David Silva and Juan Mata couldn‚Äôt even crack the bench for them.
                These days, those 2 would be Spain‚Äôs best players, albeit Rodri would compete.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Why‚Äôs this? I think that the abolition of foreign player limits has damaged the game.
                Sorry‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt entirely irrelevant, and it might come off as a diatribe‚Äîbut I think the game‚Äôs
                declined. If asked to list the top international teams from pre-Bosman times (e.g. pre-1995), most would
                name the 1960 Soviet Union, 1954 Hungary, 1984 France, and 1970 Brazil teams, amongst others. What do
                these sides have in common? Most of their players, if not all, played in their domestic countries, and,
                most importantly, they thrived there.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Take the 1970 Brazilian squad for example. These days, Tost√£o, Jairzinho, Carlos
                Alberto, G√©rson, and (especially) Pel√© would not have spent the majority of their careers in Brazil.
                They would have all been snapped up by a Real Madrid or Barcelona when they were 17. For proof, look at
                Real‚Äôs recent history with Brazillians: Vin√≠cius, Endrick, Rodrygo, and Reinier were all purchased as
                teenagers, for massive sums. If Endrick commanded ‚Ç¨60m, a 16 year old Pel√© would‚Äôve commanded ‚Ç¨200m.

            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">I think the game suffers when young players from smaller leagues prematurely join top
                teams. Vin√≠cius and Rodrygo have done bits, but they are the exception. Depay would‚Äôve been better off
                had he stayed another couple seasons at PSV, ameliorating his game and character, before entering the
                strange, cutthroat environment at Manchester United. Instead, he sunk at United, halted his development,
                and, relative to early expectations, has underperformed‚Äîalbeit he‚Äôs still had a decent career. Moving to
                a new country‚Äîwhere one needs to adapt to different customs and a new language‚Äîis not easy. But, if you
                are mature and have a good footballing education under your belt, you stand a fighting chance.

            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Some, like Vin√≠cius and Erling Haaland, have defied the odds, but they‚Äôre rare. For
                every Haaland, you get 20 Francisco Trinc√£os and 10 Renato Sancheses. But, I get why young players move.
                These days, modern football‚Äôs lopsided nature demolishes the possibility of a (relatively) obscure
                footballing country, like Scotland, Hungary, or Russia, dominating with a squad of domestic players.
                This is why young lads feel the need to uproot.

            <p class="paragraph">Back in the days, Hungarian sides regularly made runs into the UEFA Cup, European Cup,
                and Cup Winners‚Äô Cup. The likes of Ferencv√°ros, Videoton, and MTK Budapest were able to put away the
                likes of Liverpool, Manchester United, and Juventus; Dinamo Kiev, Torpedo Moscow, and Dinamo Tbilisi
                (not Russian, but Soviet) also did bits. Nowadays, Manchester United, even with how crap they are, would
                blow all of these sides away. United‚Äôs squad is too good for them, as their financial firepower is
                unmatched. Even as poor as Antony is, he‚Äôd walk into Ferencv√°ros‚Äôs and Torpedo Moscow‚Äôs sides.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Beyond the wealth gap, top sides often behave like vultures, poaching talent from lesser-known clubs in
                countries like Russia, Sweden, and Hungary. Alexander Isak is a prime example. He joined Swedish club
                AIK at the age of 6 and spent 11 years developing his skills there. As soon as he turned professional,
                Borussia Dortmund snapped him up. After just two years, Dortmund sold him to Real Sociedad. They had no
                patience, and he wasn‚Äôt able to progress and achieve sustained growth. Thankfully, Real Sociedad and
                Newcastle have proven to be more accommodating environments, and Isak‚Äôs bounced back, but others‚ÄîGa√´l
                Kakuta, Islam Feruz, and √Ångelo Henr√≠quez‚Äîweren‚Äôt as lucky.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">If a UEFA-enforced foreigner limit is reintroduced into leagues, you‚Äôd see less of this
                waste. The top clubs would be forced to develop domestic talent and dissuaded from raiding lesser clubs.
                For example: instead of wasting ¬£70m on Kalvin Phillips and Mateo Kovaƒçiƒá, City would‚Äôve given Romeo
                Lavia a chance and maintained their ties to their local community. (And, with how those two have
                performed for Abu Dhabi‚Äôs Manchester City, and how Lavia was for Southampton, there‚Äôs a good chance City
                would‚Äôve been better off.)

            <p class="paragraph">As a result, domestic leagues would improve, and the international game would be in a
                better place. Mikel Merino and Joselu, Newcastle United rejects, wouldn‚Äôt be Spain‚Äôs best players; we‚Äôd
                see more David Silvas and Xabi Alonsos. Furthermore, smaller clubs and leagues would be able to compete
                again. We probably wouldn‚Äôt see the likes of Panathinaikos or Malm√∂ FF make the Champions League final,
                the way they did in the past, but there‚Äôd be more parity. It‚Äôd fix most of the game‚Äôs problems.
                Unfortunately, it wouldn‚Äôt flush the turds that are Newcastle, PSG, and Manchester City, but it‚Äôd still
                be a big step forward.

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Scotland's Time to Shine</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Quick side-note: perhaps I‚Äôm overrating past footballers a bit. As Robert Greene says, people always
                overrate the past, especially in the face of current difficulties. But, I always strive for objectivity.
                I can see things as they are. For example, let‚Äôs look at Paolo Rossi and George Best. Paolo Rossi won
                Italy the 1982 World Cup and is seen as one of the best footballers of all time. Best was crucial to
                United‚Äôs post-Munich recovery and is viewed similarly. But, all that glitters is not gold.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/Zidane1998.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">Zidane being sent off in France's match against Saudi Arabia, 1998. Had France not
                    won the competition, maybe we'd view Zidane as a hot-headed bottler. But, Zidane was a serial
                    winner, so people overlooked his flaws.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Rossi was finished at the age of 29, and Best at 26. Rossi‚Äôs career almost ended in disgrace at the age
                of 23, when he was banned for alleged match-fixing. Best was an alcoholic and had peaked at age 22.
                Hardly the hallmarks of legendary men. Zinedine Zidane, another legend, was inconsistent; both Juventus
                and Real Madrid declined after a couple of years of the Zidane Experience. I could go on-and-on, with
                the likes of Cruyff, Bobby Moore, Paul McGrath, etc., but you get the gist. I can look past reputation
                and clamour.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">So, trust me when I say, players just ain‚Äôt the same. If you can, watch matches of the
                greats. You‚Äôll see a huge gulf in quality between them and the stars of today; few footballers shape up.
                You rarely see footballers taken on 5 players in a European Cup final, the way Best did in 1968‚Äîat the
                age of 22 nonetheless! These days, every other footballer is the same: incredible stamina, strength, and
                speed, but poor technical ability. Teams more so resemble Wimbledon than they do Ajax. A couple
                exceptions exist‚Äîe.g. Bernardo Silva, Mbappe, Modric, and Kroos‚Äîbut the game‚Äôs declined. It‚Äôs still high
                quality, but it‚Äôs at a weak point.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">That probably sounds weird to many. Past footballers, especially British ones, were
                seen as talentless, brainless workhorses, only capable of smashing into challenges. But, the likes of
                Norman Whiteside, Bryan Robson, Graeme Souness, David Rocastle, and John Robertson would put many modern
                players to shame. A 27-year old John Robertson would make Adama Traor√© look like a Sunday league
                footballer. Robertson‚Äôs crossing and dribbling, as well as the general application of his talents, were
                levels above.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">But, the game was less just during Robertson‚Äôs time. He spent his entire career at
                Nottingham Forest and Derby County, earning a pittance. Meanwhile, Adama‚Äôs used his massive biceps to
                blag his way into a ‚Ç¨100k/week deal at Barcelona. It‚Äôs a really, really weird climate. Another
                non-entity, Mykhailo Mudryk, swindled Chelsea with his neck tattoos and good looks. Footballing ability
                matters less and less. With the way the game‚Äôs gone, I reckon Christian McCaffrey could bag a move to
                Barcelona. Franz Mesmer could also snag a spot on a top club‚Äôs medical team. Probably City‚Äôs, given
                Guardiola‚Äôs history of dubious medical practices.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/McCaffrey.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">If Adama can bag a move to Barcelona, surely Christian McCaffrey could do the same?
                    They're both built similarly, and McCaffrey could probably cross the ball better.

            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">
                Anyway, as I said earlier, a lot of sides are poor, even the (supposed) top ones. Very little separates
                them from Scotland. This is just based on player quality, too. I also think managerial quality has gone
                down in recent years. I remember someone saying‚ÄîI think it was Arsene Wenger‚Äîthat a great manager can
                make a squad perform 10% better than the sum of its parts, whereas a crap one can make it perform 30%
                worse. I think most managers lean towards the latter, yet they‚Äôre still bagging top jobs. For example,
                both
                England and Portugal are coached by lads who couldn‚Äôt hack it in club football. Furthermore, I read
                recently that Bayern Munich were courting Ten Hag, Julen Lopetegui, and Ralf Rangnick for their
                managerial role. Christ. I reckon David Moyes would do a better job than all three.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-heading" id="section-8">Scotland's Key Players</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In this section, I‚Äôll be focusing on 3 footballers: McTominay, Robertson, and McGinn. These are
                Scotland‚Äôs best players, and I think they‚Äôll do damage this summer.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">This isn‚Äôt a tactical analysis; rather, it's a description of the players‚Äô qualities.
                I‚Äôll leave the formation, positioning, and so forth to Steve Clarke. Besides, I believe you‚Äôd gain more
                from an overview of the players‚Äô qualities. In my opinion, football is akin to a greedy algorithm: if
                your players consistently make the best (or second-best) decision 98% of the time, your team will likely
                win. Thus, regardless of the formation Clarke selects, Scotland‚Äôs success depends on the players‚Äô
                qualities, as well as their decision-making and ability to keep things simple. Like Bill Shankly used to
                say: just keep the ball on the ground, and pass it to an open teammate. Anyway:</p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Scott McTominay</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Scott McTominay plays for Manchester United. He is a tall, determined midfielder. Sometimes, when United
                are chasing a goal, he plays up front. He has many redeeming qualities: bottle, strength, and solid
                defensive instinct. Surprisingly, he‚Äôs also got great offensive capabilities. You wouldn‚Äôt expect that
                from a slow, lanky chap like him, but he‚Äôs class going forward. He times his runs well, akin to a young
                Dele Alli, and is a good finisher. All-in-all, he‚Äôs kinda like a jack-of-all-trades. He‚Äôs no Redondo,
                but he‚Äôll do a job well.
            </p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/McTominayTackle.jpeg" />
                <p class="caption">McTominay mimicking Ollie Chessum.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph">Sometimes, though, he lacks concentration. When United lost 2-1 to Forest, he was at
                fault for both goals. He lost his lad both times and let him get shots off. Some also say he hides from
                the ball, i.e. he doesn‚Äôt make himself open for passes. I think these criticisms are unfair. Firstly,
                when McTominay‚Äôs ‚Äúhiding,‚Äù he‚Äôs actually dragging defenders out of position and
                creating avenues for others. Secondly, yes, McTominay cocks up sometimes, but all footballers do. Forget
                the occasional gaffe. There‚Äôs a reason he plays for England‚Äôs biggest football club. He‚Äôs skilled,
                determined, and steely. He‚Äôs been able to hack it at United, whilst past ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù, like Di Mar√≠a,
                Pogba, and Ver√≥n, haven‚Äôt.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Pogba was able to coast off his talent for 6 years, but he made little-to-no impact. McTominay has made
                an impact, because his effort and attitude are spot-on 100% of the time. That‚Äôs why Ten Hag, Solskjaer,
                and Jos√© Mourinho loved him. Mourinho. That‚Äôs surprising. He‚Äôs reputed to be a chequebook manager with a
                disinclination towards youth, yet he gave McTominay a consistent role in the squad. He hasn‚Äôt done that
                with many other young lads. At the club‚Äôs end-of-season party, Mourinho even created the Manager's
                Player of the Year award to recognise McTominay‚Äôs qualities. He‚Äôs clearly a good footballer.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                Further, he shows up in big games, having put in great performances in matches against Arsenal,
                Liverpool, and Manchester City. He‚Äôs been crucial for Scotland‚Äôs qualification hopes, too: he scored a
                last-minute winner against Israel and bagged a brace against Spain. Moreover, in United‚Äôs infamous 2021
                Europa League final, he was the best player on the pitch. He didn‚Äôt hide; he pinged the ball
                cross-field, snuffed out Villarreal‚Äôs chances, and made himself available to his teammates.
                Unfortunately, United lost, but he was incredible.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Meanwhile, Paul Pogba, his flash midfield partner, was an absolute disgrace. He made poor decisions and
                had little-to-no impact on the game. He was at fault for Villarreal‚Äôs goal, as their free-kick came off
                the back of one of his many poor decisions. He had ages on the ball and plenty teammates open, but he
                picked the worst possible passing avenue and forced his teammate to make the foul. Then, Moreno scored
                off the resulting free-kick. Poor.

            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">Andy Robertson</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Andy Robertson is Liverpool‚Äôs left-back, and he‚Äôs world-class. He has humble origins.
                As a young lad, after being released from Celtic, he worked the tills at Marks & Spencer. After, Third
                Division Queen‚Äôs Park took a chance on him, and he impressed. After one season, Dundee United picked him
                up, where he also impressed. Again, after one season, Hull City signed him for a meagre ¬£2.85 million.
                He wasn‚Äôt a consistent starter, and Hull got relegated in 2015. However, Robertson established himself
                as a star in the Championship and helped get Hull promoted. Unfortunately, the season after, Hull got
                relegated again, despite having him, Harry Maguire, Kamil Grosicki, and other quality footballers.</p>

            <div class="picture-caption-container">
                <img class="picture intro-picture" src="./Images/RobertsonAndMaguire.webp" />
                <p class="caption">Two great footballers.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">After Hull‚Äôs second relegation, both Robertson and Maguire were picked up by Liverpool
                and Leicester, respectively. Much like at Hull, Robertson had a slow start at Liverpool, only making 30
                appearances in his first season. However, the year Liverpool won the Champions League, Robertson had a
                blinder. He made 48 appearances and established himself as a mainstay in Klopp‚Äôs team, endearing himself
                to the fans with his incredible work ethic and attitude. However, beyond the intangibles, he‚Äôs a
                talented footballer, with incredible crossing ability and decision-making, albeit not on the level of
                his Trent Alexander-Arnold, his right-sided counterpart.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">As Scotland often play a back 3, Robertson plays as a left wing-back. He doesn‚Äôt have
                as much impact for Scotland as he does for Liverpool. Obviously a world-class talent, but he has
                struggled to elevate his teammates to his level. It‚Äôs easy playing one-twos with Wijnaldum and Mane, or
                putting in crosses for Van Dijk and Firmino, but replicating that impact with the likes of Oliver
                McBurnie and Ryan Christie is a different story. However, I back him to make a difference this
                tournament. Scotland have their strongest squad in decades, with Lyndon Dykes, Che Adams, and Jacob
                Brown offering more reliable outlets. This summer, he‚Äôll do great.
            </p>

            <h1 class="sub-sub-heading">John McGinn</h1>
            <p class="paragraph">Now, John McGinn is class. He has played for Aston Villa the last 6 years, and he‚Äôs
                been excellent. In his first season at Villa, 2018-19, he helped them get promoted and was named the
                club‚Äôs Player of the Season. Since then, Villa have survived in the Premier League and, barring the
                Gerrard blip, have gotten better each season. This season, they‚Äôll likely finish 4th place and play
                Champions League football for the first time in ages. I think the last time they‚Äôd played in the
                European Cup was in 1983, the season after they‚Äôd won it. He has played a huge role in bringing Villa
                back to those heights.

            <p class="paragraph">Unlike McTominay, McGinn is naturally gifted, with great vision, passing, and
                dribbling. A bit of a silly comparison, but he‚Äôs akin to Mateo Kovaƒçiƒá, with better passing ability. His
                engine is incredible, too. All of these qualities have made him the first name on both Scotland‚Äôs and
                Villa‚Äôs team sheets. This chap is really, really good, and I genuinely mean that.

                Scotland‚Äôs group consists of Hungary, Germany, and Switzerland. If this were 1954, then Scotland would
                be in huge trouble. Pusk√°s, Hidegkuti, and Kocsis would demolish the Scots, and Fritz Walter would score
                a hat-trick of outside-the-foot curlers. The Scots would exit the tournament in disarray, and the
                Hungarians would maraud their way to victory.

                couple of decent ones, Willi Orban and Peter Gulacsi. The rest are journeymen. Although they did the
                double over England in 2022, they‚Äôve struggled against the likes of Luxembourg, Lithuania, and Bulgaria
                in recent times. They‚Äôre no pushovers, but they‚Äôre not world-beaters, either, and they haven‚Äôt been for
                a while.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">Germany, on the other hand, are footballing royalty. They have won the World Cup four
                times and the European Championship three times. The likes of Gerd M√ºller, Franz Beckenbauer, Lothar
                Matth√§us, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, G√ºnter Netzer, and Bernd Schuster are amongst the greats, and
                Bundesliga sides have regularly dominated European competition.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">In 2024, Germany are still class. Xabi Alonso‚Äôs Bayer Leverkusen have established
                themselves as a top side, erasing their Neverkusen monicker. Bayern have lost Lewandowski and are
                struggling in the Bundesliga, but still have a chance of winning the Champions League. The national team
                has Kroos, M√ºller, G√ºndogan, and Neuer‚Äîall world-class footballers‚Äîbut it seems their time is up. They
                fell at the first hurdle in both 2014 and 2018 and were poor against England in 2021. Having serial
                winners in the squad always boosts your chances, but their lacklustre performances in three of the last
                four major tournaments don't inspire confidence. You can never count Germany out, though. In 1954,
                Hungary battered them 8-3 in the group stages, yet lost 2-1 to them in the World Cup final. All they
                need is to endure attacks, and they'll eventually catch a spark. The Scots need to be cautious.

                <p class="caption">Germany are a fantastic international side, arguably the best ever, but they've been
                    poor as of late.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">Switzerland and Scotland are similar, though Scotland are bigger bottlers. Both sides
                haven‚Äôt gone deep into tournaments before, but Switzerland have had less quality. In recent times,
                they‚Äôve churned out Granit Xhaka, Xherdan Shaqiri, Yann Sommer, Manuel Akanji, and Stephan
                Lichsteiner‚Äîall of whom are class. Compared to Scotland‚Äôs recent output‚ÄîScott McTominay, Andy Robertson,
                and John McGinn‚Äîand it‚Äôs clear that the two countries are on similar pegging.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">However, in terms of historic quality, it‚Äôs a wash. St√©phane Chapuisat is Switzerland‚Äôs
                best ever player, and, to be fair, he was class. But, he‚Äôs one of the few world-class players that
                Switzerland have produced. As for Scotland, it‚Äôs a long list: Bremner, Law, Souness, Dalglish, Hansen,
                Robertson, Mackay, etc. Obviously, current quality is all that matters, but the Scots have a CV, whereas
                the Swiss don‚Äôt. Could it make a difference? No idea. To be honest, I know nowt about Switzerland.
                Regardless, I back the Scots to beat them, just because.

                </p>
            </div>

            <p class="paragraph">All in all, I think Scotland draw 1-1 with Germany, and they beat Switzerland 2-1
                and Hungary 3-0.
                I back the Scots to top the group; I think Germany will draw against Switzerland. As for the rest of the
                tournament? I don‚Äôt care. All I know is, Scotland will make the final and batter whoever‚Äôs in their way.

            <p class="paragraph">
                All in all, Scotland is a remarkable country with a unique, storied history. Its football is rooted in
                greatness, marked by chaps like Denis Law, Jim Baxter, and Billy McNeill, who once propelled Scotland to
                the forefront of world football. Although recent performances have been poor, Scotland's passion for
                football remains. In the 2024 Euros, there‚Äôs a chance that the Scots rekindle their history, tap into
                their reserves of steel, and go on a legendary run. They need to remember their roots, how they so
                bravely fought back against the English, Norse, and Romans, and how they were the first to beat England
                after their World Cup victory, essentially making them Champions of the World. If they do, it doesn‚Äôt
                matter who they play; everyone‚Äôs getting battered. Mark my words: they‚Äôre winning the competition.
