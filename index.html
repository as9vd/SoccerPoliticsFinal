            <p class="paragraph">
                To many, Scotland is a land of misbehaving drunkards, who live in clans, wear kilts, guzzle Scotch, and
                speak in thick accents. The country is cold, dark, and unforgiving. The football is similarly abject:
                the national team has been crap for ages, and Scottish sides regularly get boyed off in Europe. All in
                all, Scotland seems grim.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                However, if you dig deeper, you’ll see that Scotland’s not what its detractors—mainly the English—have
                made it out to be. It’s a belting place, with a rich legacy of culture and prestige. Also, Scotland’s
                clubs were once able to go toe-to-toe with Europe’s top sides. Unfortunately, recent
                predicaments—poverty, homelessness, mass emigration, and poor football—sully its image.
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                What is Scotland’s legacy? Why has the country been in perpetual decline? How did Scottish football go
                from Jimmy Johnstone, Billy Bremner, and Denis Law, to Oliver McBurnie and Grant Hanley? And, despite
                this drastic decline, why do I still back the Scots to make a run in the 2024 European Championship?

                Stones began his career with Barnsley, making his first-team debut in the Championship in March 2012 as
                a
                17-year-old. He joined Premier League club Everton for around £3 million in January 2013 and amassed 95
                appearances over four seasons. In August 2016, he signed for Manchester City for an initial £47.5
                million
                with add-ons. With the club, he has won five Premier League titles, two EFL Cups, two FA Cups, and the
                UEFA
                Champions League as part of a historic continental treble in the 2022–23 season.

                On 9 August 2016, Manchester City completed the signing of Stones for £47.5 million on a six-year
                contract
                with a potential extra £2.5 million in add-ons, making him the world's second most expensive defender in
                history, behind David Luiz. The announcement followed shortly after the leaking of his
                arrival, having been included in City's Champions League play-off round squad registration list which
                UEFA
                had published on their website prior to confirmation of the move. Through a 15% sell-on clause, Barnsley
                received £6.78 million from Stones' transfer to Manchester City, an amount larger than any transfer fee
                they
                had received in their history.

                Uzbekistan is a secular state, with a presidential constitutional government in place. Uzbekistan
                comprises 12 regions (vilayats), Tashkent City, and one autonomous republic, Karakalpakstan. While
                non-governmental organisations have defined Uzbekistan as "an authoritarian state with limited civil
                rights", significant reforms under Uzbekistan's second president, Shavkat Mirziyoyev, have been
                made following the death of the first president, Islam Karimov. Owing to these reforms, relations with
                the neighbouring countries of Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Afghanistan have drastically
                improved. A United Nations report of 2020 found much progress toward achieving the UN's
                Sustainable Development Goals.

            <p class="paragraph">
                The Uzbek economy is in a gradual transition to the market economy, with foreign trade policy being
                based on import substitution. In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible at
                market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of cotton. With the gigantic power-generation
                facilities from the Soviet era and an ample supply of natural gas, Uzbekistan has become the largest
                electricity producer in Central Asia. From 2018 to 2021, the republic received a BB−sovereign
                credit rating by both Standard and Poor (S&P) and Fitch Ratings. The Brookings Institution described
                Uzbekistan as having large liquid assets, high economic growth, low public debt, and a low GDP per
                capita. Uzbekistan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), United Nations (UN)
                and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).

                The region currently known as the country of Uzbekistan has been referred to by many names over the
                millennia. The name, Uzbekistan first appears in 16th century literature. Other names for the region
                include: Transoxonia, Sogdia, and the Khanate of Bukhara. In the 14th century the region served as the
                birthplace, home, and capital of Tamerlane. Under Tamerlane, the region was a part of the Timurid Empire
                which extended from the Black Sea to the Arabian Sea, and to just outside of Delhi, India.

                The first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were Scythians who came from the northern
                grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan, sometime in the first millennium BC; when these nomads settled in
                the region they built an extensive irrigation system along the rivers. At this time, cities such as
                Bukhoro (Bukhara) and Samarqand (Samarkand) emerged as centres of government and high culture. By
                the fifth century BC, the Bactrian, Sogdian, and Tokharian states dominated the region.

                As East Asia began to develop its silk trade with the West, Using an extensive network of cities and
                rural settlements in the province of Transoxiana, and further east in what is today Xinjiang, the
                Sogdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these merchants. As a result of this trade on what
                became known as the Silk Route, Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at
                times Transoxiana (Mawarannahr) was one of the most influential and powerful provinces of antiquity.

                In 327 BC, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire provinces of Sogdiana and
                Bactria, which contained the territories of modern Uzbekistan. Popular resistance to the conquest was
                fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the
                Macedonian Greco-Bactrian Kingdom. The kingdom was replaced with the Yuezhi-dominated Kushan Empire in
                the first century BC. For many centuries thereafter the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by the Parthian
                and Sassanid Empires, as well as by other empires, for example, those formed by the Turkic Gokturk
                peoples.

                Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family
                members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, there was an orderly succession for several
                generations, and control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of
                Chagatai Khan, the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace
                prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom,
                the Golden Horde.

                Tamerlane also established an exchange of medical discoveries and patronised physicians, scientists and
                artists from the neighbouring regions such as India. His grandson Ulugh Beg was one of the world's
                first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the Chaghatai
                dialect, became a literary language in its own right in Transoxiana, although the Timurids were
                Persianate in culture. The greatest Chaghataid writer, Ali-Shir Nava'i, was active in the city of Herat
                (now in northwestern Afghanistan) in the second half of the 15th century.
